<h1>HCPH SUD Data</h1>
<p>The Hamilton County Public Health (HCPH) substance use disorder (SUD) data agreement was initiated in July 2024 and the agreement was for data collected starting August 1, 2024 through July 31, 2025. This agreement is for EIP to provide HCPH with data regarding SUD screening and follow-up at periodic intervals to determine retention in care. The agreement was to provide data for any patient that endorses any opioid and/or stimulant use, the demographic information of these individuals, as well as their treatment need and follow-up for retention in care. This agreement is for patients seen at UC Medical Center only.</p>
<p>Since the data that HCPH requested for follow-up centered around those that were linked to care, it was decided that aggregate data would be collected for all those individuals screened for SUD, those that endorse current opioid/stimulant use within the past year, those that are engaged with the EIP Linkage to Care process, and those that are successfully linked to care. Then, record-level data would be provided for those that agree to follow-up questionnaires at 30, 60, and 180 day time points, with the follow-up questions from HCPH documented.</p>
<p>EIP SUD assessments are determined based on the AUDIT-C for alcohol or NIDA-Modified ASSIST for all other substances. Aggregate-level data is presented here for the following: number screened for SUD, number endorsing current opioid/stimulant use (within the past year), number engaged in SUD linkage, number successfully linked to care, and the number that agreed to follow-up beyond linkage success. As of the start of the data sharing agreement for this program, there have been a total of <strong>802 encounters where an individual was screened for SUD</strong>. The number of encounters where an individual has endorsed current substance use (<em>within the past year</em>) for opioids and/or stimulants were <strong>210 encounters</strong> (<em>26.2% of all those screened for SUD, 210/802</em>). After a conversation with the EIP HPA and/or LTC Coordinator, there was a total of <strong>97 encounters</strong> where the individual engaged in our linkage process specifically for SUD (<em>46.2% of all those who endorsed current opioid/stimulant use, 97/210</em>). For those that engaged with our SUD LTC process, there were a total of <strong>33 encounters where the individual was successfully linked to care for SUD</strong> (<em>34.0% of all those engaged in SUD LTC, 33/97</em>). There were then a total of <strong>27 encounters</strong> where the individual agreed to additional follow-up beyond successful linkage for SUD (<em>81.8% of all those successfully linked to care for SUD, 27/33</em>). The table below summarizes this monthly aggregate-level data for SUD screening and linkage to care at UCMC ED since the start of this program.</p>

<p>The remaining data covers the follow-up efforts towards this project, specifically the eligibility and completion of the 30/60/180 day time points. Everyone who agreed to the additional follow-up is eligible for the 30 day follow-up as long as their follow-up date is 30-days after their successful linkage to care date for SUD. Eligibility for 60-day follow-up requires the individual complete their 30-day follow-up and that we have reached 60-days post-linkage. Eligibility for the 180-day follow-up requires successful completion of their 60-day follow-up and that we have reached 180-day post-linkage. There were a total of <strong>27 encounters where the individual agreed to the HCPH 30/60/180 day follow-ups after successful linkage</strong> (<em>81.8% of all those successfully linked to care for SUD, 27/33</em>). These are the individuals that are being followed-up with by our linkage team for responses to the HCPH 30/60/180 day follow-up surveys.</p>
<p>There were a total of <strong>30</strong> encounters (<em>111.1% of all those successfully linked to care for SUD</em>) where the individual was eligible for their 30 day follow-up, and our linkage team was successfully able to <strong>complete 5 of these 30 day follow-ups</strong> (<em>16.7% of all those eligible for their 30 day follow-up, 5/30</em>).</p>
<p>There were a total of <strong>5</strong> encounters (<em>100.0% of all those who successfully completed their 30 day follow-up</em>) where the individual was eligible for their 60 day follow-up, and our linkage team was successfully able to <strong>complete 2 of these 60 day follow-ups</strong> (<em>40.0% of all those eligible for their 60 day follow-up, 2/5</em>).</p>
<p>There were a total of <strong>0</strong> encounters (<em>NA of all those who successfully completed their 60 day follow-up</em>) where the individual was eligible for their 180 day follow-up, and our linkage team was successfully able to <strong>complete 0 of these 180 day follow-ups</strong> (<em>NA of all those eligible for their 180 day follow-up, 0/2</em>).</p>

<h1>Ask, Advise, Refer (AAR)</h1>
<p>The HCPH Ask, Advise, Refer partnership was signed on <em>April 26, 2024</em>. This partnership was a pledge from EIP to HCPH that we would increase education and awareness of tobacco cessation and cessation-related services. Through this pledge, EIP promised to participate in tobacco use screening and referral to cessation resources, namely the Ohio Tobacco Quit Line. The program officially started documenting referrals for tobacco cessation referrals on <strong>August 13, 2024</strong>.</p>
<p>EIP staff screen for tobacco use by asking about current tobacco use on the risk assessment. If the patient endorses current tobacco use (either daily or less than daily), they are instructed to provide tobacco cessation referrals to the Ohio Tobacco Quit Line, and document that the referral was provided in their REDCap record.</p>
<p>Since the start of this program in August, there have been a total of <strong>138 encounters where an individual was screened for their tobacco use history</strong>, with a total of <strong>48 that endorse current tobacco use</strong> (<em>34.8% of all those screened, 48/138</em>). For all those who have endorsed current tobacco use, EIP has provided <strong>0 referrals</strong> to the Ohio Tobacco Quit Line (<em>0.0% of all those who endorse current tobacco use, 0/48</em>). The table below summarizes the monthly tobacco assessments, the number who endorse current tobacco use, and the number that were referred for tobacco cessation through the Ohio Tobacco Quit Line.</p>

<h1>Harm Reduction</h1>
<section id="fentanyl-test-strips" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fentanyl-test-strips">Fentanyl Test Strips</h2>
<p>During the EIP assessment and discussion with the patient/client, the HPA asks questions regarding the individual’s knowledge of harm reduction tools. More specifically, the individual is asked whether they are aware of tools used to test drugs for the presence of fentanyl, meaning their knowledge of fentanyl test strips (FTS). This assessment of their knowledge of harm reduction tools is available for all those receiving an EIP assessment, regardless of any indication of their own history of substance use. The total number of assessments where this question was answered was 943 (<em>19.1% of all assessments completed, 943/4946</em>). This question asks for a yes/no response, and the total number of assessments where the indiviudal responded that they were aware of FTS was 461 (<em>48.9% of all those asked about their knowledge of FTS, 461/943</em>). If they stated that they were aware of FTS, the indiviudal is then asked about their prior use of these harm reduction tools. The total number of assessments where the individual stated that they were aware of FTS that answered this follow-up question was 407 (<em>88.3% of all assessments where the individual was aware of FTS, 407/461</em>). Again, this is a yes/no response, and the total number of assessments where the individual stated that they have used FTS before was 223 (<em>54.8% of all assessments where the individual was asked about prior FTS use, 223/407</em>).</p>
<p>For those individuals that screened positive for any type of SUD through the EIP assessment, the number of assessments where they were also assessed for their knowledge of FTS was 351 (<em>29.0% of all SUD positive assessments, 351/1211</em>), with 194 stating that they were aware of FTS (<em>55.3% of all SUD positive assessments where the individual was also assessed for FTS knowledge, 194/351</em>). The number of assessments where the individual screened positive for any SUD where they were also assessed for their prior use of FTS was 184 (<em>94.8% of all SUD positive assessments that were aware of FTS, 184/194</em>), with 107 endorsing prior use of FTS (<em>58.2% of all SUD positive assessments also assessed for prior FTS use, 107/184</em>).</p>
<p>During each encounter, individuals are also offered these harm reduction tools and provided with FTS if they are interested in receiving them at that time. The number of assessments where individuals who were asked whether they would be interested in recieving FTS was 959 (<em>19.4% of all assessments, 959/4946</em>), with 394 stating that they were interested (<em>41.1% of all assessed for interest in receiving FTS, 394/959</em>). Once they stated that they had an interst in recieving FTS during their encounter, the HPA documents whether they were able to provide the individual with FTS and how many they were given for reporting purposes. The number of times the individual was provided with FTS during their encounter was 373 (<em>94.7% of all times when the individual stated interest in receiving FTS, 373/394</em>).</p>
<p>For those that screened positive for any type of SUD during their encounter, the number of assessments where individuals who were asked whether they would be interested in recieving FTS was 351 (<em>29.0% of all assessments where the individual screened positive for a SUD, 351/1211</em>), with 173 stating that they were interested (<em>49.3% of all SUD positive assessments also assessed for interest in receiving FTS, 173/351</em>). The number of times where the individual screened positive for a SUD and was provided with FTS during their encounter was 165 (<em>95.4% of all times when the individual screened SUD positive and stated interest in receiving FTS, 165/173</em>).</p>
<p>The total number of FTS distributed is reported on a monthly basis required for being a Project Dawn site, starting <strong>August 1st, 2023</strong>. Therefore, the total number of strips distributed are counted on a monthly basis and provided in the graph.</p>

<p><em>It is important to note that the number represented here is the number of individual strips, not the number of kits. Standard FTS kits are in packages of 5 strips, and the EIP HPA can select this as an option when documenting the distribution of FTS to individuals. However, they are also able to document non-standard amounts that are distributed in a free text field. Therefore, anytime they select that they distributed the standard kit of 5 strips, this is counted as five individual strips and combined with the free text field of non-standard distribution.</em></p>

<section id="naloxone-distribution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="naloxone-distribution">Naloxone Distribution</h2>
<p><strong>Work in progress</strong></p>
<p>Naloxone distribution is documented in two different programs within EIP: (1) direct naloxone distribution of kits provided through grants, and (2) facilitated distribution where EIP prompts medical staff to distribute naloxone from the Omnicell within UCMC and WCH EDs after discussion with the patient. The two programs will be discussed separately below. Also, the number of kits distributed from the UCMC and WCH Omnicells will be provided with the direct distribution information because those numbers are reported alongside the distribution of our EIP kits.</p>
<p>With Project Dawn naloxone distribution, there are three different “versions” or methods of distribution that are recorded: (1) Individual distribution, (2) Transfer to an agency, and (3) Overdose Awareness Day and Recovery Month Event. For each of these versions of distribution, there are different data points collected and required for reporting. Individual distribution is when we provide naloxone kits to an individual person, and we collect data regarding their demographics, area in which they live, and past history with overdose and naloxone use. Transfer to an agency is when we provide a batch of kits for an agency for them to distribute on their own, and we just document how many kits were provided to them, but no additional information is collected as with individual distributions. Finally, Overdose Awareness Day (OAD) and Recovery month events are any combination of the first two versions, only that they must occur on OAD (August 31st) or during recovery month (September 30th). With this version, we also only collect specifics about the setting of the distribution and the total number of kits, but not information about the individual receiving the naloxone kit(s). The table below shows the total number of distribution events (not number of kits) for each of these types of distribution versions.</p>

<p>Additionally for transferring kits to an agency, Project Dawn asks for additional information regarding the type of transfer. There are three transfer types: (1) One-time partner for distribution, (2) Service entity first aid, and (3) Public NaloxBox/cabinet. The table below shows the number of distribution events (not number of kits) involving a transfer of kits to an agency for each of these transfer types.</p>

<p>The plot below shows the monthly naloxone kit distributions, which are the numbers reported to ODH each month. This plot shows how many kits were distributed by EIP through various community engagements (regular sites and/or special events) as well as the number of kits that are distributed through UCMC and WCH ED through the Omnicell each month.</p>

There are different reports required to the local health department, Hamilton County Public Health (HCPH), and to the state health department, Ohio Department of Health (ODH). The report for HCPH is due by the 5th of the month for the prior month’s testing data. This report includes the total number of CTR-funded tests performed, how many were reactive (and then confirmed positive), and whether those positive tests were for patients newly-diagnosed or for a person known to be living with HIV. Additionally, the total number of assessments conducted, and how many individuals were tested and assessed are reported to HCPH each month for CTR. The report sent to ODH each month consists of the total number of CTR-funded tests, and how many individuals were newly diagnosed with HIV from testing. Additionally, the ODH report consists of the assessment data for each negative test, only providing the ODH assessment questions. The ODH report is divided into three parts: 1) the number of tests and assessment data for all those testing negative, 2) the opscan data for all those testing negative, 3) the supplemental opscan data for those that were tested but did not have an assessment conducted at the time of the test. The table to the right shows the total number of CTR tests and the overall positivity rate. The figure below shows the monthly CTR testing numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    CTR Deliverable \n    Prior Goal \n    Updated Goal \n    Change \n  \n \n\n  PLWHA\n\n    PLWHA not in care \n    100 \n    125 \n    +25 \n  \n  \n    PLWHA at UCMC \n    75 \n    100 \n    +25 \n  \n  \n    PLWHA/WOC \n    20 \n    25 \n    +5 \n  \n  \n    PLWHA/IDU \n    25 \n    35 \n    +10 \n  \n  MSM\n\n    MSM assessed \n    100 \n    140 \n    +40 \n  \n  \n    MSM/Youth tested \n    20 \n    25 \n    +5 \n  \n  \n    MSM/IDU tested \n    20 \n    25 \n    +5 \n  \n  HRHS\n\n    HRHS assessed \n    1000 \n    1150 \n    +150 \n  \n  \n    HRHS/WOC tested \n    100 \n    130 \n    +30 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe deliverables highlighted below are the numbers that were noted on the 2023 CTR Workplan as what our program would accomplish within the year of funding awarded. The original workplan specified data that was collected starting January 1st, 2023 through December 31, 2023. However, an update with funding allocation for both the CTR and EHE programs allowed for a change to the deliverables for CTR and the timeframe for those deliverables. The data in the table to the right shows the deliervables that were updated based on this change. The changes in these deliverables were made based on the estimated possibility of reaching these goals based on the numbers we had reached at the time the changes were initiated. For example, some of the deliverables were already met, so those numbers were increased due to the likelihood of surpassing the original goal; some deliverables were close to being met, so they may have been increased slightly; and some deliverables were not close to being met, so they were not changed in the hopes that we would be able to meet those original goals by the new extended timeframe. The updates in these deliverable goals were made on December 18th, 2023. The table to the right only shows those deliverables that were updated, and all other deliverables are the same as the original deliverables set in the 2023 workplan.\nThe data shown in the table below covers the updated CTR program deliverables starting January 1st, 2023 through May 31, 2024 in accordance with those workplan updates. A summary table of the CTR deliverables, the number of each deliverable achieved, and the percent of the deliverables met are shown below:\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    CTR Deliverable \n    Achieved \n    Goal \n    % \n  \n \n\n  PLWHA\n\n    PLWHA not in care \n    86 \n    125 \n    68.8% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA at UCMC \n    63 \n    100 \n    63.0% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA at WCH \n    9 \n    15 \n    60.0% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA at the Exchange \n    3 \n    5 \n    60.0% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA at Talbert \n    1 \n    5 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA/WOC \n    10 \n    25 \n    40.0% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA/Youth \n    21 \n    25 \n    84.0% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA/IDU \n    22 \n    35 \n    62.9% \n  \n  \n    % PLWHA linked \n    68.6% \n    80% \n     \n  \n  MSM\n\n    MSM assessed \n    122 \n    140 \n    87.1% \n  \n  \n    MSM tested \n    58 \n    100 \n    58.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM tested at UCMC \n    32 \n    75 \n    42.7% \n  \n  \n    MSM tested at WCH \n    2 \n    10 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM tested at the Exchange \n    14 \n    10 \n    140.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM tested at Talbert \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM/Youth tested \n    27 \n    25 \n    108.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM/IDU tested \n    20 \n    25 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM new positive \n    6 \n    3 \n    200.0% \n  \n  HRHS\n\n    HRHS assessed \n    1024 \n    1150 \n    89.0% \n  \n  \n    HRHS tested \n    565 \n    900 \n    62.8% \n  \n  \n    HRHS tested at UC \n    391 \n    550 \n    71.1% \n  \n  \n    HRHS tested at WCH \n    6 \n    100 \n    6.0% \n  \n  \n    HRHS tested at the Exchange \n    110 \n    150 \n    73.3% \n  \n  \n    HRHS tested at Talbert \n    45 \n    100 \n    45.0% \n  \n  \n    HRHS/WOC tested \n    181 \n    130 \n    139.2% \n  \n  \n    HRHS/Youth tested \n    198 \n    200 \n    99.0% \n  \n  \n    HRHS/IDU tested \n    172 \n    300 \n    57.3% \n  \n  \n    HRHS new positive \n    5 \n    9 \n    55.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first impact objective encompasses population-based objectives centered around people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) that are identified not in care. This objective has EIP staff identify those either newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed with HIV and determine whether they are out of care, requiring linkage to care services. This objective is inclusive of those who are women of color (WOC), youth (15-29 years old), and injection drug users (IDU). The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below, with the original workplan deliverable crossed out in replace of the updated CTR deliverables:\n\nBy December 31, 2023, EIP will perform 100 risk assessments on PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC site, 15 WCH at site, 5 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site; of which will be 20 WOC, 25 Youth (18-29), and 25 IDU) as prioritized by RFP workplan table\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will perform 125 risk assessments on PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care, inclusive of the following (100 at UCMC site, 15 WCH at site, 5 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site; of which will be 20 WOC, 25 Youth (18-29), and 35 IDU) as prioritized by RFP workplan table\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many PLWHA who are out of care that will be identified by our program, and successfully link 80% of those individuals to care. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nPLWHA are identified in several different ways within the program, including: self-report of a prior positive test during the assessment of HIV testing history, reason for offering an HIV test was due to a prior HIV positive result, declining an HIV test due to prior positive result, a final positive result through HIV testing, or having an HIV linkage case open with a new or previous HIV status. EIP staff are meant to identify all PLWHA encountered through the program, with further follow-up and discussion meant to determine who is currently out of care. The deliverable for all PLWHA identified out of care are those that are “eligible” to be linked to care wihtin the linkage flow process (noted below). They are considered “ineligible” based on the following criteria: they are already linked to care, they are deceased, they are currently incarcerated, we do not have accurate contact information for them, they already have an ongoing linke case for HIV, or they declined EIP linkage services. The numbers provided here are based on the total number of encounters, not unique number of patients, because EIP may encounter individuals frequently throughout the reporting period and identify them as being out of care during any of these encounters.\nThe total number of HIV linkage to care (LTC) cases initiated for PLWHA during this time period is 342, with the total number of “eligible” LTC cases for PLWHA being 86 (25.1% of all HIV LTC cases initiated, 86/342). Therefore, EIP has identified 86 PLWHA for the CTR deliverable, which is 68.8% of the total promise of 125. The total number of these “eligible” HIV LTC cases that have been successfully linked to care is 59, which is 68.6% of those “eligible” (59/86).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not separate linkage numbers based on the HIV testing program (CTR/EHE), so these numbers are pulled the same as the numbers that are reported for the linkage deliverables shown for the EHE program. The difference in the reported numbers are due to the timeframe used for CTR deliverables. Current CTR deliverables are for data collected between 1/1/2023-5/31/2024 and current EHE deliverables are for data collected between 8/1/2023-5/31/2024. The HIV Linkage flow diagram for the CTR deliverable timeframe is shown below to provide an understanding of where the linkage numbers are coming from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional deliverables were made for identifying PLWHA at specific sites where EIP operates. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 63 PLWHA identified at UCMC, which is 63.0% of the total promise of 100. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 9 PLWHA identified at at WCH, which is 60.0% of the total promise of 15. For the community-based tests, there are only deliverables for those CTR tests conducted at the Exchange locations and Talbert locations. For the Exchange locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any location where the Syringe Service Program (SSP) operates. There were a total number of 3 PLWHA identified at Exchange locations, which is 60.0% of the total promise of 5. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 1 PLWHA identified at Talbert locations, which is 20.0% of the total promise of 5.\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for linkage to care. EIP additionally has deliverables for those who are HIV+ and are also WOC, youth and IDU. For those who are WOC, this is defined as any individual who identifies as female whose race/ethnicity is not ‘White/Caucasian’. There were a total number of 10 PLWHA who were also WOC, which is 40.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 21 PLWHA who were also Youth, which is 84.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 22 PLWHA who were also IDU, which is 62.9% of the total promise of 35.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were additional deliverables made for population-based objectives, and the first focuses on those who identify as men who have sex with other men (MSM). Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below, with the original workplan deliverable crossed out in replace of the updated CTR deliverables:\n\nBy December 31, 2023, EIP will identify 100 MSM for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 100 MSM, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC site, 10 at WCH site, 10 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site ; of which will be 20 Youth (15-29) and 20 IDU). Of the 100 MSM tested, EIP will identify between 3-5 HIV(+) MSM for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will identify 140 MSM for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 100 MSM, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC site, 10 at WCH site, 10 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site ; of which will be 25 Youth (15-29) and 25 IDU). Of the 100 MSM tested, EIP will identify between 3-5 HIV(+) MSM for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many MSM will be assessed for risk and/or need, and how many MSM will be tested using CTR-funded tests. Additionally, EIP states a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, the Exchange, and Talbert). EIP also states how many MSM will be tested using CTR-funded tests who are also youth (15-29) and injection drug users (IDU), as well as a specific number of newly diagnosed individuals who identify as MSM. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nFor those individuals who identify as a male, they are determined to be a MSM if they meet at least one of the following criteria: they identify as Male and their sexual orientation is homosexual or bisexual, they report sex with a male or a transgender male within the past year, or they are a PLWHA and their reported risk was MSM. The total number of individuals who are MSM that have been assessed during this time period is 122, which is 87.1% of the total promise of 140.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of individuals who are MSM that have been tested through the CTR program is 58, which is 58.0% of the total promise of 100. In addition to the total number of tests, there were deliverables for the location where those tests were conducted. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 32 CTR tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 42.7% of the total promise of 75. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 2 CTR tests that were conducted at WCH, which is 20.0% of the total promise of 10. For the community-based tests, there are only deliverables for those CTR tests conducted at the Exchange locations and Talbert locations. For the Exchange locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any location where the Syringe Service Program (SSP) operates. There were a total number of 14 CTR tests that were conducted at Exchange locations, which is 140.0% of the total promise of 10. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 5 CTR tests that were conducted at Talbert locations, which is 100.0% of the total promise of 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the CTR workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals who identify as MSM who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 6 MSM CTR tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 200.0% of the total promise of 3. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the CTR program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be further broken down monthly to determine how frequently we test those who identify as MSM, and determine if program evaluation needs to occur based on how we can increase testing for this population or whether decreased testing numbers are due to staffing changes and program barriers. The monthly breakdown of MSM CTR testing by month is shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for testing. Within the population of MSM, we additionally have deliverables for youth and IDU. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 27 CTR tests where the individual was both MSM/Youth, which is 108.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 20 CTR tests where the individual was both MSM/IDU, which is 80.0% of the total promise of 25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were additional deliverables made for population-based objectives, and the second focuses on those who identify as heterosexual that are at high risk for contracting HIV by endorsing high-risk heterosexual sex (HRHS) behaviors. Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy December 31, 2023, EIP will identify 1000 HRHS for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 900 HRHS, inclusive of the following (550 UCMC at site, 100 WCH at site, 150 at Exchange site, 100 Talbert at House facility site; of which will be 100 WOC, 200 Youth (15-29), and 300 IDU). Of the 900 HRHS tested, EIP will identify 9 HIV(+) HRHS for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will identify 1150 HRHS for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 900 HRHS, inclusive of the following (550 UCMC at site, 100 WCH at site, 150 at Exchange site, 100 Talbert at House facility site; of which will be 130 WOC, 200 Youth (15-29), and 300 IDU). Of the 900 HRHS tested, EIP will identify 9 HIV(+) HRHS for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many HRHS will be assessed for risk and/or need, how many HRHS individuals will be tested through CTR-funded tests, and state a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, the Exchange, and Talbert). Additionally, EIP stated specific populations within those who are HRHS, including WOC, youth (15-29), and IDU. EIP also stated a specific number of individuals newly diagnosed with HIV through CTR testing. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nFor those individuals who identify as a heterosexual (men who have sex with women, or women who have sex with men), they are determined to be HRHS if they meet at least one of the following criteria: heterosexual women that have unprotected sex with men or MSM, heterosexual men/women that have sex with an IDU, an HIV positive partner, a STD positive partner, more than three partners, or heterosexual men/women that exchange money/drugs for sex. These behaviors are all within the past year.\nThe total number of encounters with individuals who are HRHS that have been assessed during this time period is 1024, which is 89.0% of the total promise of 1150. In addition to the total number of assessments, there were deliverables for the number of CTR-funded tests performed. The total number of encounters where HRHS individuals were tested is 565, which is 62.8% of the total promise of 900. There were also deliverables for the number of tests performed at specific sites where EIP operates. For UCMC, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by a CTR test that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 391 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 71.1% of the total promise of 550. For WCH, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by a CTR test that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 6 CTR HRHS assessments that were conducted at WCH, which is 6.0% of the total promise of 100. For the community-based tests, this includes those CTR-funded tests that were conducted at either the Exchange or Talbert sites. For the Exchange, this includes any site where the SSP operates. There were a total number of 110 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at the Exchange, which is 73.3% of the total promise of 150. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 45 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at Talbert, which is 45.0% of the total promise of 100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the CTR workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals that are HRHS who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 5 HRHS CTR tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 55.6% of the total promise of 9. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the CTR program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be further broken down monthly to determine how frequently we test those who are HRHS, and determine if program evaluation needs to occur based on how we can increase testing for this population or whether decreased testing numbers are due to staffing changes and program barriers. The monthly breakdown of HRHS CTR testing by month is shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for testing. Within the population of HRHS, we additionally have deliverables for WOC, youth and IDU. For those who are WOC, this is defined as any individual who identifies as female whose race/ethnicity is not ‘White/Caucasian’. There were a total number of 181 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/WOC, which is 139.2% of the total promise of 130. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 198 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/Youth, which is 99.0% of the total promise of 200. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 172 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/IDU, which is 57.3% of the total promise of 300.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional metrics still to code for:\n\nNumber of PLWHA approached\nNumber receiving intervention\nNumber of interactions between EIP staff and site staff\nNumber/% of PLWHA not in care (new and previous)\nNumber/% of PLWHA linked to medical care and other services\nNumber/% of PLWHA receiving risk assessment and counseling\nNumber of MSM approached\nNumber of MSM receiving intervention\nNumber/% of HIV(-) MSM receiving risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral\nNumber/% of MSM receiving HIV testing\nNumber/% of MSM who test HIV+\nNumber HRHS approached\nNumber receiving intervention\nNumber/% of HIV(-) HRHS receiving risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral\nNumber/% of HRHS receiving HIV testing\nNumber/% HRHS who test HIV+"

The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below, with the original workplan deliverable crossed out in replace of the updated CTR deliverables:\n\nBy December 31, 2023, EIP will perform 100 risk assessments on PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC site, 15 WCH at site, 5 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site; of which will be 20 WOC, 25 Youth (18-29), and 25 IDU) as prioritized by RFP workplan table\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will perform 125 risk assessments on PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care, inclusive of the following (100 at UCMC site, 15 WCH at site, 5 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site; of which will be 20 WOC, 25 Youth (18-29), and 35 IDU) as prioritized by RFP workplan table\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many PLWHA who are out of care that will be identified by our program, and successfully link 80% of those individuals to care. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nPLWHA are identified in several different ways within the program, including: self-report of a prior positive test during the assessment of HIV testing history, reason for offering an HIV test was due to a prior HIV positive result, declining an HIV test due to prior positive result, a final positive result through HIV testing, or having an HIV linkage case open with a new or previous HIV status. EIP staff are meant to identify all PLWHA encountered through the program, with further follow-up and discussion meant to determine who is currently out of care. The deliverable for all PLWHA identified out of care are those that are “eligible” to be linked to care wihtin the linkage flow process (noted below). They are considered “ineligible” based on the following criteria: they are already linked to care, they are deceased, they are currently incarcerated, we do not have accurate contact information for them, they already have an ongoing linke case for HIV, or they declined EIP linkage services. The numbers provided here are based on the total number of encounters, not unique number of patients, because EIP may encounter individuals frequently throughout the reporting period and identify them as being out of care during any of these encounters.\nThe total number of HIV linkage to care (LTC) cases initiated for PLWHA during this time period is 342, with the total number of “eligible” LTC cases for PLWHA being 86 (25.1% of all HIV LTC cases initiated, 86/342). Therefore, EIP has identified 86 PLWHA for the CTR deliverable, which is 68.8% of the total promise of 125. The total number of these “eligible” HIV LTC cases that have been successfully linked to care is 59, which is 68.6% of those “eligible” (59/86).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not separate linkage numbers based on the HIV testing program (CTR/EHE), so these numbers are pulled the same as the numbers that are reported for the linkage deliverables shown for the EHE program. The difference in the reported numbers are due to the timeframe used for CTR deliverables. Current CTR deliverables are for data collected between 1/1/2023-5/31/2024 and current EHE deliverables are for data collected between 8/1/2023-5/31/2024. The HIV Linkage flow diagram for the CTR deliverable timeframe is shown below to provide an understanding of where the linkage numbers are coming from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional deliverables were made for identifying PLWHA at specific sites where EIP operates. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 63 PLWHA identified at UCMC, which is 63.0% of the total promise of 100. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 9 PLWHA identified at at WCH, which is 60.0% of the total promise of 15. For the community-based tests, there are only deliverables for those CTR tests conducted at the Exchange locations and Talbert locations. For the Exchange locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any location where the Syringe Service Program (SSP) operates. There were a total number of 3 PLWHA identified at Exchange locations, which is 60.0% of the total promise of 5. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 1 PLWHA identified at Talbert locations, which is 20.0% of the total promise of 5.\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for linkage to care. EIP additionally has deliverables for those who are HIV+ and are also WOC, youth and IDU. For those who are WOC, this is defined as any individual who identifies as female whose race/ethnicity is not ‘White/Caucasian’. There were a total number of 10 PLWHA who were also WOC, which is 40.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 21 PLWHA who were also Youth, which is 84.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 22 PLWHA who were also IDU, which is 62.9% of the total promise of 35."

EIP will provide CTR testing to 100 MSM, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC site, 10 at WCH site, 10 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site ; of which will be 20 Youth (15-29) and 20 IDU). Of the 100 MSM tested, EIP will identify between 3-5 HIV(+) MSM for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will identify 140 MSM for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 100 MSM, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC site, 10 at WCH site, 10 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site ; of which will be 25 Youth (15-29) and 25 IDU). Of the 100 MSM tested, EIP will identify between 3-5 HIV(+) MSM for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many MSM will be assessed for risk and/or need, and how many MSM will be tested using CTR-funded tests. Additionally, EIP states a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, the Exchange, and Talbert). EIP also states how many MSM will be tested using CTR-funded tests who are also youth (15-29) and injection drug users (IDU), as well as a specific number of newly diagnosed individuals who identify as MSM. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nFor those individuals who identify as a male, they are determined to be a MSM if they meet at least one of the following criteria: they identify as Male and their sexual orientation is homosexual or bisexual, they report sex with a male or a transgender male within the past year, or they are a PLWHA and their reported risk was MSM. The total number of individuals who are MSM that have been assessed during this time period is 122, which is 87.1% of the total promise of 140.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of individuals who are MSM that have been tested through the CTR program is 58, which is 58.0% of the total promise of 100. In addition to the total number of tests, there were deliverables for the location where those tests were conducted. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 32 CTR tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 42.7% of the total promise of 75. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 2 CTR tests that were conducted at WCH, which is 20.0% of the total promise of 10. For the community-based tests, there are only deliverables for those CTR tests conducted at the Exchange locations and Talbert locations. For the Exchange locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any location where the Syringe Service Program (SSP) operates. There were a total number of 14 CTR tests that were conducted at Exchange locations, which is 140.0% of the total promise of 10. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 5 CTR tests that were conducted at Talbert locations, which is 100.0% of the total promise of 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the CTR workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals who identify as MSM who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 6 MSM CTR tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 200.0% of the total promise of 3. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the CTR program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be further broken down monthly to determine how frequently we test those who identify as MSM, and determine if program evaluation needs to occur based on how we can increase testing for this population or whether decreased testing numbers are due to staffing changes and program barriers. The monthly breakdown of MSM CTR testing by month is shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for testing. Within the population of MSM, we additionally have deliverables for youth and IDU. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 27 CTR tests where the individual was both MSM/Youth, which is 108.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 20 CTR tests where the individual was both MSM/IDU, which is 80.0% of the total promise of 25."

Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy December 31, 2023, EIP will identify 1000 HRHS for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 900 HRHS, inclusive of the following (550 UCMC at site, 100 WCH at site, 150 at Exchange site, 100 Talbert at House facility site; of which will be 100 WOC, 200 Youth (15-29), and 300 IDU). Of the 900 HRHS tested, EIP will identify 9 HIV(+) HRHS for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will identify 1150 HRHS for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 900 HRHS, inclusive of the following (550 UCMC at site, 100 WCH at site, 150 at Exchange site, 100 Talbert at House facility site; of which will be 130 WOC, 200 Youth (15-29), and 300 IDU). Of the 900 HRHS tested, EIP will identify 9 HIV(+) HRHS for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many HRHS will be assessed for risk and/or need, how many HRHS individuals will be tested through CTR-funded tests, and state a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, the Exchange, and Talbert). Additionally, EIP stated specific populations within those who are HRHS, including WOC, youth (15-29), and IDU. EIP also stated a specific number of individuals newly diagnosed with HIV through CTR testing. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nFor those individuals who identify as a heterosexual (men who have sex with women, or women who have sex with men), they are determined to be HRHS if they meet at least one of the following criteria: heterosexual women that have unprotected sex with men or MSM, heterosexual men/women that have sex with an IDU, an HIV positive partner, a STD positive partner, more than three partners, or heterosexual men/women that exchange money/drugs for sex. These behaviors are all within the past year.\nThe total number of encounters with individuals who are HRHS that have been assessed during this time period is 1024, which is 89.0% of the total promise of 1150. In addition to the total number of assessments, there were deliverables for the number of CTR-funded tests performed. The total number of encounters where HRHS individuals were tested is 565, which is 62.8% of the total promise of 900. There were also deliverables for the number of tests performed at specific sites where EIP operates. For UCMC, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by a CTR test that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 391 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 71.1% of the total promise of 550. For WCH, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by a CTR test that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 6 CTR HRHS assessments that were conducted at WCH, which is 6.0% of the total promise of 100.

There were a total number of 110 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at the Exchange, which is 73.3% of the total promise of 150. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 45 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at Talbert, which is 45.0% of the total promise of 100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses.

There were a total number of 8 EHE tests that were conducted in the community, which is 80.0% of the total promise of 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the EHE workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 0 EHE tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 10. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the EHE program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the EHE program addresses particular population groups for testing. Within the population of MSM, we additionally have deliverables for youth and IDU. For those that are considered in the youth population, EHE defines those between the age of 18-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 18, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 5 EHE tests where the individual was both MSM/Youth, which is 12.5% of the total promise of 40. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 0 EHE tests where the individual was both MSM/IDU, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 10."

    "text": "HRHS\nThere were additional deliverables made for population-based objectives, and the second focuses on those who identify as heterosexual that are at high risk for contracting HIV by endorsing high-risk heterosexual sex (HRHS) behaviors. Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2024, UC EIP will identify 450 HRHS for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including 350 UCMC site, 50 WCH site, and 50 community/outpatient sites).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many HRHS will be assessed for risk and/or need, and state a specific number of assessments at each site (UCMC, WCH, community sites). Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table in the next section.\nFor those individuals who identify as a heterosexual (men who have sex with women, or women who have sex with men), they are determined to be HRHS if they meet at least one of the following criteria: heterosexual women that have unprotected sex with men or MSM, heterosexual men/women that have sex with an IDU, an HIV positive partner, a STD positive partner, more than three partners, or heterosexual men/women that exchange money/drugs for sex.\nThe total number of individuals who are HRHS that have been assessed during this time period is 473, which is 105.1% of the total promise of 450. In addition to the total number of assessments, there were deliverables for the location where those assessments were conducted. For UCMC, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by an EHE test that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED). There were a total number of 343 EHE HRHS assessments that were conducted at UCMC, which is 98.0% of the total promise of 350. For WCH, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by an EHE test that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED). There were a total number of 13 EHE HRHS assessments that were conducted at WCH, which is 26.0% of the total promise of 50. For the community-based assessments, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by an EHE test that were conducted anywhere EIP operates that does not include one of the EDs (UCMC or WCH). There were a total number of 117 EHE HRHS assessments that were conducted in the community, which is 234.0% of the total promise of 50."

    "text": "The Epic dashboard for HCV testing went live on January 2nd, 2024. This Epic dashboard lists all University of Cincinnati Medical Center Emergency Department (UCMC ED) based HCV testing ordered, showing the results in real time. EIP staff monitors the HCV dashboard for positive results and approaches patients directly while they are still in the ED, or the hospital, to provide results, education and information for additional testing (if required), as well as linkage to care through UC’s Clinical Pharmacy when appropriate.\nThe total daily testing numbers for HCV Antibody tests (HCV Ab) are shown in the table below, as well as a plot showing the daily trend in testing numbers. The overall HCV Ab positivity rate for the tests included in the HCV Epic Dashboard is described below the plot. The unique number of tests is determined by the Order ID for the test. The test is only included if the Order Status is “Completed” and the Lab Status indicates that it is the “Final Result” and the lab result is provided. The data is manually exported from the Epic HCV Dashboard each week with the data from the prior week by the EIP Data Team, and merged into a single data file used in this analysis, excluding duplicate records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that since the HCV Epic dashboard data is manually extracted from Epic at various times, the total number of tests for the most recent day may not all be counted. For example, if data is pulled in the afternoon, then the tests conducted in the morning are counted, but not tests conducted later in the evening for that day. The day that the data was pulled is noted by the date at the top of this report. Also, depending on when the data was pulled, not all test results are finalized, so the positivity rate and number of positive tests/patients may also be slightly different. However, this should only pertain to the day the data is pulled, and not prior days included in the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of HCV Ab tests since the initiation of the HCV Dashboard is 6327 tests. The total number of positive HCV Ab results is 257 Ab positive tests, which is 4.06% of all HCV Ab tests conducted (257/6327).\nSince EIP is meant to approach each individual that has a reactive HCV Ab test to provide education, the data provided in the remainder of this report will focus on the unique number of patients rather than number of tests, and those patients that were followed up with by our staff and referred to UC’s Clinical Pharmacy. Since the start of the HCV Dashboard, there have been a total of 6182 unique patients that have been tested for HCV Ab, with a total of 243 unique patients that were positive for HCV Ab (3.93% of all patients tested, 243/6182). The unique number of patients tested is determined by the medical record number (MRN) attached to the lab test. The MRN is the identifier used to match back with the EIP REDCap Database to link with the patient’s record to determine follow-up efforts described in the next section.\n\n\n\nA summary flow diagram for EIP’s follow-up efforts regarding those that are identified HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard is provided below. You can zoom into this flow diagram by clicking on the image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs already mentioned, there were a total of 243 HCV Ab+ patients from the Epic HCV Dashboard. There were a total of 9 patients (3.7% of all HCV Ab+ patients, 9/243) that currently do not have an EIP record created for follow-up regarding their HCV Ab+ result, which are in the process of being added. Based on further HCH RNA testing or recent medical record review, it is known that 94 patients are currently HCV RNA negative (38.7% of all those identified as HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard, 94/243). While EIP is not calling all those identified as HCV RNA negative to discuss those results due to the additional effort that would be, we do try to notify these patients and provide additional education and interpretation of these results if we catch them while they are still in the ED/hospital. The total number of patients EIP has provided follow-up education after their HCV RNA results negative is 17 patients (18.1% of all those identified as HCV RNA negative, 17/94).\nTherefore, the number of patients who were identified as HCV Ab+ but either are HCV RNA positive or do not have a RNA lab resulted was 140 patients needing follow-up education and referral (57.6% of all those HCV Ab+ from the Epic HCV Dashboard, 140/243). This means that EIP has been unable to follow-up with 73 patients who were HCV Ab+ and need follow-up results/education (52.1% of all those HCV Ab+ from the Epic HCV Dashboard needing follow-up, 73/140)\nOut of those patients that needed follow-up, EIP staff were able to approach and provide results/education to 67 patients (47.9% of all those identified as HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard needing follow-up, 67/140). EIP makes every attempt to approach the patient while they are still located in the ED or admitted to the hospital. The number of patients where EIP was able to initiate face-to-face contact while they were still in the hospital (whether in the ED or roomed elsewhere) was 32 patients (47.8% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 32/67). If EIP is unable to approach patients while they were still in the ED/hospital, then attempts are made to follow-up with them using the contact information collected during ED intake. The number of patients where EIP was able to contact them after discharge was 34 patients (50.7% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 34/67).\nAs part of EIP’s follow-up efforts, we try to ensure anyone who is HCV Ab+ has the necessary lab testing to know if they are currently infected with HCV by facilitating RNA testing when appropriate. The total number of patients that had a follow-up RNA test documented within their EIP REDCap record was 183 patients (71.2% of all those HCV Ab+, 183/243). As mentioned above, there were a total of 94 patients that were negative for HCV RNA, which is 38.7% of all those with a known HCV RNA result (94/183). For those patients that were tested for RNA, the total number of those that were found to be true positives for HCV was 85 patients (46.4% of all those tested for HCV RNA, 85/183). This is the total number of patients that will be used to determine who was successfully referred to the UC Clinical Pharmacy telehealth appointment system.\nThe EIP REDCap Database is currently set-up for documentation regarding referral to UC Clinical Pharmacy. However, there is still discussion regarding a job aide for proper flow of referrals and management for the telehealth appointments with UC Clinical Pharmacy. Until this is finalized, the data regarding these referrals will be ad hoc when needed.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to evaluate whether we have appropriate EIP staff coverage for this project, this section looks at the time that the HCV Ab test results are available and whether there is an EIP staff member dedicated for this project on staff. Therefore, we can know whether our staff is available to approach the patient in the ED/hospital when the lab results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCV Dashboard dataset does not include Lab Result times.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result times for the labs are estimated using the Order Date/Time and estimated resulting time based on CHI lab data.\n\n\n\nThe HCV Dashboard does not include result times for the labs. Therefore, an average HCV Ab lab result time was calculated from CHI HCV Ab lab data and used here (CHI HCV Ab lab result times average is about 3 hours and 53 minutes). The HCV Ab dashboard lab result times were estimated by adding this average lab result time from the CHI lab data onto the Order Date/Time values for the dashboard labs. Since these are estimated lab result times, there is some variability in this data. Also, since these are estimates, EIP staff coverage times are estimated since those can vary slightly week to week.\nSince these lab result times are estimates, they have been categorized into four categories to simplify the plot: Overnight (12am-5:59am), Morning (6am-11:59am), Afternoon (12pm-5:59pm), and Evening (6pm-11:59pm). Employee staff coverage is used an estimated based on these same parameters. Current staff coverage was used based on the staff shift schedule noted below:\n\nRK: Monday-Thursday (7am-5pm; morning-afternoon) or Tuesday-Friday (7am-5pm; morning-afternoon), alternating weeks\nJF: Monday and Friday (10am-10pm; morning-evening) and Tuesday (9am-9pm; morning-evening)\n\nTherefore, it is estimated that EIP staff is available for this project during these times:\n\nMonday morning - evening\nTuesday morning - evening\nWednesday morning - afternoon\nThursday morning - afternoon\nFriday morning - evening\n\nThe plot below shows the days and time periods of the estimated HCV Ab+ lab result times, as well as the times that there is EIP coverage. The frequency shows the total number of HCV Ab+ results for each day/time since the start of the project. The colored bars indicates that there is EIP staff scheduled during this time to respond to the HCV Dashboard and approach those patients who are HCV Ab+.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below summarizes the total number of HCV Ab+ results where an EIP staff member assigned for this project was on shift, and the percentage of the total HCV Ab+ results. This table indicates that EIP staff was available during 50.6% of the HCV Ab+ labs when they were estimated to have resulted and appear in the HCV Dashboard (130/257). Also, this table shows that EIP staff was not on shift for this project during 49.4% of the HCV Ab+ labs when they were estimated to have resulted (127/257).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Frequency\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nWith EIP Coverage\n130\n50.6%\n\n\nWithout EIP Coverage\n127\n49.4%"

More specifically, the individual is asked whether they are aware of tools used to test drugs for the presence of fentanyl, meaning their knowledge of fentanyl test strips (FTS). This assessment of their knowledge of harm reduction tools is available for all those receiving an EIP assessment, regardless of any indication of their own hisotyr of substance use. The total number of assessments where this question was answered was 754 (25.3% of all assessments completed, 754/2976). This question asks for a yes/no response, and the total number of assessments where the indiviudal responded that they were aware of FTS was 386 (51.2% of all those asked about their knowledge of FTS, 386/754). If they stated that they were aware of FTS, the indiviudal is then asked about their prior use of these harm reduction tools. The total number of assessments where the individual stated that they were aware of FTS that answered this follow-up question was 336 (87.0% of all assessments where the individual was aware of FTS, 336/386). Again, this is a yes/no response, and the total number of assessments where the individual stated that they have used FTS before was 187 (55.7% of all assessments where the individual was asked about prior FTS use, 187/336).\nFor those individuals that screened positive for any type of SUD through the EIP assessment, the number of assessments where they were also assessed for their knowledge of FTS was 306 (39.9% of all SUD positive assessments, 306/766), with 167 stating that they were aware of FTS (54.6% of all SUD positive assessments where the individual was also assessed for FTS knowledge, 167/306). The number of assessments where the individual screened positive for any SUD where they were also assessed for their prior use of FTS was 158 (94.6% of all SUD positive assessments that were aware of FTS, 158/167), with 88 endorsing prior use of FTS (55.7% of all SUD positive assessments also assessed for prior FTS use, 88/158).\nDuring each encounter, individuals are also offered these harm reduction tools and provided with FTS if they are interested in receiving them at that time. The number of assessments where individuals who were asked whether they would be interested in recieving FTS was 778 (26.1% of all assessments, 778/2976), with 354 stating that they were interested (45.5% of all assessed for interest in receiving FTS, 354/778). Once they stated that they had an interst in recieving FTS during their encounter, the HPA documents whether they were able to provide the individual with FTS and how many they were given for reporting purposes. The number of times the individual was provided with FTS during their encounter was 334 (94.4% of all times when the individual stated interest in receiving FTS, 334/354).\nFor those that screened positive for any type of SUD during their encounter, the number of assessments where individuals who were asked whether they would be interested in recieving FTS was 307 (40.1% of all assessments where the individual screened positive for a SUD, 307/766), with 154 stating that they were interested (50.2% of all SUD positive assessments also assessed for interest in receiving FTS, 154/307). The number of times where the individual screened positive for a SUD and was provided with FTS during their encounter was 146 (94.8% of all times when the individual screened SUD positive and stated interest in receiving FTS, 146/154).\nThe total number of FTS distributed is reported on a monthly basis required for being a Project Dawn site, starting August 1st, 2023. Therefore, the total number of strips distributed are counted on a monthly basis and provided in the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the number represented here is the number of individual strips, not the number of kits. Standard FTS kits are in packages of 5 strips, and the EIP HPA can select this as an option when documenting the distribution of FTS to individuals. However, they are also able to document non-standard amounts that are distributed in a free text field.

    "text": "During the EIP assessment and discussion with the patient/client, the HPA asks questions regarding the individual’s knowledge of harm reduction tools. More specifically, the individual is asked whether they are aware of tools used to test drugs for the presence of fentanyl, meaning their knowledge of fentanyl test strips (FTS). This assessment of their knowledge of harm reduction tools is available for all those receiving an EIP assessment, regardless of any indication of their own hisotyr of substance use. The total number of assessments where this question was answered was 754 (25.3% of all assessments completed, 754/2976). This question asks for a yes/no response, and the total number of assessments where the indiviudal responded that they were aware of FTS was 386 (51.2% of all those asked about their knowledge of FTS, 386/754). If they stated that they were aware of FTS, the indiviudal is then asked about their prior use of these harm reduction tools. The total number of assessments where the individual stated that they were aware of FTS that answered this follow-up question was 336 (87.0% of all assessments where the individual was aware of FTS, 336/386). Again, this is a yes/no response, and the total number of assessments where the individual stated that they have used FTS before was 187 (55.7% of all assessments where the individual was asked about prior FTS use, 187/336).\nFor those individuals that screened positive for any type of SUD through the EIP assessment, the number of assessments where they were also assessed for their knowledge of FTS was 306 (39.9% of all SUD positive assessments, 306/766), with 167 stating that they were aware of FTS (54.6% of all SUD positive assessments where the individual was also assessed for FTS knowledge, 167/306). The number of assessments where the individual screened positive for any SUD where they were also assessed for their prior use of FTS was 158 (94.6% of all SUD positive assessments that were aware of FTS, 158/167), with 88 endorsing prior use of FTS (55.7% of all SUD positive assessments also assessed for prior FTS use, 88/158).\nDuring each encounter, individuals are also offered these harm reduction tools and provided with FTS if they are interested in receiving them at that time. The number of assessments where individuals who were asked whether they would be interested in recieving FTS was 778 (26.1% of all assessments, 778/2976), with 354 stating that they were interested (45.5% of all assessed for interest in receiving FTS, 354/778). Once they stated that they had an interst in recieving FTS during their encounter, the HPA documents whether they were able to provide the individual with FTS and how many they were given for reporting purposes. The number of times the individual was provided with FTS during their encounter was 334 (94.4% of all times when the individual stated interest in receiving FTS, 334/354).\nFor those that screened positive for any type of SUD during their encounter, the number of assessments where individuals who were asked whether they would be interested in recieving FTS was 307 (40.1% of all assessments where the individual screened positive for a SUD, 307/766), with 154 stating that they were interested (50.2% of all SUD positive assessments also assessed for interest in receiving FTS, 154/307). The number of times where the individual screened positive for a SUD and was provided with FTS during their encounter was 146 (94.8% of all times when the individual screened SUD positive and stated interest in receiving FTS, 146/154).\nThe total number of FTS distributed is reported on a monthly basis required for being a Project Dawn site, starting August 1st, 2023. Therefore, the total number of strips distributed are counted on a monthly basis and provided in the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the number represented here is the number of individual strips, not the number of kits. Standard FTS kits are in packages of 5 strips, and the EIP HPA can select this as an option when documenting the distribution of FTS to individuals. However, they are also able to document non-standard amounts that are distributed in a free text field. Therefore, anytime they select that they distributed the standard kit of 5 strips, this is counted as five individual strips and combined with the free text field of non-standard distribution."

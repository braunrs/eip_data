There are different reports required to the local health department, Hamilton County Public Health (HCPH), and to the state health department, Ohio Department of Health (ODH). The report for HCPH is due by the 5th of the month for the prior month’s testing data. This report includes the total number of CTR-funded tests performed, how many were reactive (and then confirmed positive), and whether those positive tests were for patients newly-diagnosed or for a person known to be living with HIV. Additionally, the total number of assessments conducted, and how many individuals were tested and assessed are reported to HCPH each month for CTR. The report sent to ODH each month consists of the total number of CTR-funded tests, and how many individuals were newly diagnosed with HIV from testing. Additionally, the ODH report consists of the assessment data for each negative test, only providing the ODH assessment questions. The ODH report is divided into three parts: 1) the number of tests and assessment data for all those testing negative, 2) the opscan data for all those testing negative, 3) the supplemental opscan data for those that were tested but did not have an assessment conducted at the time of the test. The table to the right shows the total number of CTR tests and the overall positivity rate.

The original workplan specified data that was collected starting January 1st, 2023 through December 31, 2023. However, an update with funding allocation for both the CTR and EHE programs allowed for a change to the deliverables for CTR and the timeframe for those deliverables. The data in the table to the right shows the deliervables that were updated based on this change. The changes in these deliverables were made based on the estimated possibility of reaching these goals based on the numbers we had reached at the time the changes were initiated. For example, some of the deliverables were already met, so those numbers were increased due to the likelihood of surpassing the original goal; some deliverables were close to being met, so they may have been increased slightly; and some deliverables were not close to being met, so they were not changed in the hopes that we would be able to meet those original goals by the new extended timeframe. The updates in these deliverable goals were made on December 18th, 2023. The table to the right only shows those deliverables that were updated, and all other deliverables are the same as the original deliverables set in the 2023 workplan.\nThe data shown in the table below covers the updated CTR program deliverables starting January 1st, 2023 through May 31, 2024 in accordance with those workplan updates. A summary table of the CTR deliverables, the number of each deliverable achieved, and the percent of the deliverables met are shown below:\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    CTR Deliverable \n    Achieved \n    Goal \n    % \n  \n \n\n  PLWHA\n\n    PLWHA not in care \n    89 \n    125 \n    71.2% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA at UCMC \n    67 \n    100 \n    67.0% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA at WCH \n    8 \n    15 \n    53.3% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA at the Exchange \n    3 \n    5 \n    60.0% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA at Talbert \n    1 \n    5 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA/WOC \n    11 \n    25 \n    44.0% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA/Youth \n    21 \n    25 \n    84.0% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA/IDU \n    23 \n    35 \n    65.7% \n  \n  \n    % PLWHA linked \n    68.5% \n    80% \n     \n  \n  MSM\n\n    MSM assessed \n    126 \n    140 \n    90.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM tested \n    61 \n    100 \n    61.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM tested at UCMC \n    34 \n    75 \n    45.3% \n  \n  \n    MSM tested at WCH \n    2 \n    10 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM tested at the Exchange \n    15 \n    10 \n    150.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM tested at Talbert \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM/Youth tested \n    28 \n    25 \n    112.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM/IDU tested \n    21 \n    25 \n    84.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM new positive \n    6 \n    3 \n    200.0% \n  \n  HRHS\n\n    HRHS assessed \n    1051 \n    1150 \n    91.4% \n  \n  \n    HRHS tested \n    604 \n    900 \n    67.1% \n  \n  \n    HRHS tested at UC \n    422 \n    550 \n    76.7% \n  \n  \n    HRHS tested at WCH \n    6 \n    100 \n    6.0% \n  \n  \n    HRHS tested at the Exchange \n    118 \n    150 \n    78.7% \n  \n  \n    HRHS tested at Talbert \n    45 \n    100 \n    45.0% \n  \n  \n    HRHS/WOC tested \n    194 \n    130 \n    149.2% \n  \n  \n    HRHS/Youth tested \n    210 \n    200 \n    105.0% \n  \n  \n    HRHS/IDU tested \n    185 \n    300 \n    61.7% \n  \n  \n    HRHS new positive \n    5 \n    9 \n    55.6% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first impact objective encompasses population-based objectives centered around people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) that are identified not in care. This objective has EIP staff identify those either newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed with HIV and determine whether they are out of care, requiring linkage to care services. This objective is inclusive of those who are women of color (WOC), youth (15-29 years old), and injection drug users (IDU). The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below, with the original workplan deliverable crossed out in replace of the updated CTR deliverables:\n\nBy December 31, 2023, EIP will perform 100 risk assessments on PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC site, 15 WCH at site, 5 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site; of which will be 20 WOC, 25 Youth (18-29), and 25 IDU) as prioritized by RFP workplan table\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will perform 125 risk assessments on PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care, inclusive of the following (100 at UCMC site, 15 WCH at site, 5 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site; of which will be 20 WOC, 25 Youth (18-29), and 35 IDU) as prioritized by RFP workplan table\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many PLWHA who are out of care that will be identified by our program, and successfully link 80% of those individuals to care. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nPLWHA are identified in several different ways within the program, including: self-report of a prior positive test during the assessment of HIV testing history, reason for offering an HIV test was due to a prior HIV positive result, declining an HIV test due to prior positive result, a final positive result through HIV testing, or having an HIV linkage case open with a new or previous HIV status. EIP staff are meant to identify all PLWHA encountered through the program, with further follow-up and discussion meant to determine who is currently out of care. The deliverable for all PLWHA identified out of care are those that are “eligible” to be linked to care wihtin the linkage flow process (noted below). They are considered “ineligible” based on the following criteria: they are already linked to care, they are deceased, they are currently incarcerated, we do not have accurate contact information for them, they already have an ongoing linke case for HIV, or they declined EIP linkage services. The numbers provided here are based on the total number of encounters, not unique number of patients, because EIP may encounter individuals frequently throughout the reporting period and identify them as being out of care during any of these encounters.\nThe total number of HIV linkage to care (LTC) cases initiated for PLWHA during this time period is 353, with the total number of “eligible” LTC cases for PLWHA being 89 (25.2% of all HIV LTC cases initiated, 89/353). Therefore, EIP has identified 89 PLWHA for the CTR deliverable, which is 71.2% of the total promise of 125. The total number of these “eligible” HIV LTC cases that have been successfully linked to care is 61, which is 68.5% of those “eligible” (61/89).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not separate linkage numbers based on the HIV testing program (CTR/EHE), so these numbers are pulled the same as the numbers that are reported for the linkage deliverables shown for the EHE program. The difference in the reported numbers are due to the timeframe used for CTR deliverables. Current CTR deliverables are for data collected between 1/1/2023-5/31/2024 and current EHE deliverables are for data collected between 8/1/2023-5/31/2024. The HIV Linkage flow diagram for the CTR deliverable timeframe is shown below to provide an understanding of where the linkage numbers are coming from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional deliverables were made for identifying PLWHA at specific sites where EIP operates. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 67 PLWHA identified at UCMC, which is 67.0% of the total promise of 100. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 8 PLWHA identified at at WCH, which is 53.3% of the total promise of 15. For the community-based tests, there are only deliverables for those CTR tests conducted at the Exchange locations and Talbert locations. For the Exchange locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any location where the Syringe Service Program (SSP) operates. There were a total number of 3 PLWHA identified at Exchange locations, which is 60.0% of the total promise of 5. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 1 PLWHA identified at Talbert locations, which is 20.0% of the total promise of 5.\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for linkage to care. EIP additionally has deliverables for those who are HIV+ and are also WOC, youth and IDU. For those who are WOC, this is defined as any individual who identifies as female whose race/ethnicity is not ‘White/Caucasian’. There were a total number of 11 PLWHA who were also WOC, which is 44.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 21 PLWHA who were also Youth, which is 84.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 23 PLWHA who were also IDU, which is 65.7% of the total promise of 35.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were additional deliverables made for population-based objectives, and the first focuses on those who identify as men who have sex with other men (MSM). Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below, with the original workplan deliverable crossed out in replace of the updated CTR deliverables:\n\nBy December 31, 2023, EIP will identify 100 MSM for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 100 MSM, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC site, 10 at WCH site, 10 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site ; of which will be 20 Youth (15-29) and 20 IDU). Of the 100 MSM tested, EIP will identify between 3-5 HIV(+) MSM for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will identify 140 MSM for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 100 MSM, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC site, 10 at WCH site, 10 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site ; of which will be 25 Youth (15-29) and 25 IDU). Of the 100 MSM tested, EIP will identify between 3-5 HIV(+) MSM for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many MSM will be assessed for risk and/or need, and how many MSM will be tested using CTR-funded tests. Additionally, EIP states a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, the Exchange, and Talbert). EIP also states how many MSM will be tested using CTR-funded tests who are also youth (15-29) and injection drug users (IDU), as well as a specific number of newly diagnosed individuals who identify as MSM. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nFor those individuals who identify as a male, they are determined to be a MSM if they meet at least one of the following criteria: they identify as Male and their sexual orientation is homosexual or bisexual, they report sex with a male or a transgender male within the past year, or they are a PLWHA and their reported risk was MSM. The total number of individuals who are MSM that have been assessed during this time period is 126, which is 90.0% of the total promise of 140.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of individuals who are MSM that have been tested through the CTR program is 61, which is 61.0% of the total promise of 100. In addition to the total number of tests, there were deliverables for the location where those tests were conducted. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 34 CTR tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 45.3% of the total promise of 75. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 2 CTR tests that were conducted at WCH, which is 20.0% of the total promise of 10. For the community-based tests, there are only deliverables for those CTR tests conducted at the Exchange locations and Talbert locations. For the Exchange locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any location where the Syringe Service Program (SSP) operates. There were a total number of 15 CTR tests that were conducted at Exchange locations, which is 150.0% of the total promise of 10. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 5 CTR tests that were conducted at Talbert locations, which is 100.0% of the total promise of 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the CTR workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals who identify as MSM who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 6 MSM CTR tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 200.0% of the total promise of 3. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the CTR program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be further broken down monthly to determine how frequently we test those who identify as MSM, and determine if program evaluation needs to occur based on how we can increase testing for this population or whether decreased testing numbers are due to staffing changes and program barriers. The monthly breakdown of MSM CTR testing by month is shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for testing. Within the population of MSM, we additionally have deliverables for youth and IDU. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 28 CTR tests where the individual was both MSM/Youth, which is 112.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 21 CTR tests where the individual was both MSM/IDU, which is 84.0% of the total promise of 25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were additional deliverables made for population-based objectives, and the second focuses on those who identify as heterosexual that are at high risk for contracting HIV by endorsing high-risk heterosexual sex (HRHS) behaviors. Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy December 31, 2023, EIP will identify 1000 HRHS for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 900 HRHS, inclusive of the following (550 UCMC at site, 100 WCH at site, 150 at Exchange site, 100 Talbert at House facility site; of which will be 100 WOC, 200 Youth (15-29), and 300 IDU). Of the 900 HRHS tested, EIP will identify 9 HIV(+) HRHS for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will identify 1150 HRHS for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 900 HRHS, inclusive of the following (550 UCMC at site, 100 WCH at site, 150 at Exchange site, 100 Talbert at House facility site; of which will be 130 WOC, 200 Youth (15-29), and 300 IDU). Of the 900 HRHS tested, EIP will identify 9 HIV(+) HRHS for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many HRHS will be assessed for risk and/or need, how many HRHS individuals will be tested through CTR-funded tests, and state a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, the Exchange, and Talbert). Additionally, EIP stated specific populations within those who are HRHS, including WOC, youth (15-29), and IDU. EIP also stated a specific number of individuals newly diagnosed with HIV through CTR testing. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nFor those individuals who identify as a heterosexual (men who have sex with women, or women who have sex with men), they are determined to be HRHS if they meet at least one of the following criteria: heterosexual women that have unprotected sex with men or MSM, heterosexual men/women that have sex with an IDU, an HIV positive partner, a STD positive partner, more than three partners, or heterosexual men/women that exchange money/drugs for sex. These behaviors are all within the past year.\nThe total number of encounters with individuals who are HRHS that have been assessed during this time period is 1051, which is 91.4% of the total promise of 1150. In addition to the total number of assessments, there were deliverables for the number of CTR-funded tests performed. The total number of encounters where HRHS individuals were tested is 604, which is 67.1% of the total promise of 900. There were also deliverables for the number of tests performed at specific sites where EIP operates. For UCMC, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by a CTR test that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 422 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 76.7% of the total promise of 550. For WCH, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by a CTR test that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 6 CTR HRHS assessments that were conducted at WCH, which is 6.0% of the total promise of 100. For the community-based tests, this includes those CTR-funded tests that were conducted at either the Exchange or Talbert sites. For the Exchange, this includes any site where the SSP operates. There were a total number of 118 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at the Exchange, which is 78.7% of the total promise of 150. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 45 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at Talbert, which is 45.0% of the total promise of 100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the CTR workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals that are HRHS who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 5 HRHS CTR tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 55.6% of the total promise of 9. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the CTR program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be further broken down monthly to determine how frequently we test those who are HRHS, and determine if program evaluation needs to occur based on how we can increase testing for this population or whether decreased testing numbers are due to staffing changes and program barriers. The monthly breakdown of HRHS CTR testing by month is shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for testing. Within the population of HRHS, we additionally have deliverables for WOC, youth and IDU. For those who are WOC, this is defined as any individual who identifies as female whose race/ethnicity is not ‘White/Caucasian’. There were a total number of 194 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/WOC, which is 149.2% of the total promise of 130. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 210 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/Youth, which is 105.0% of the total promise of 200. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 185 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/IDU, which is 61.7% of the total promise of 300.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional metrics still to code for:\n\nNumber of PLWHA approached\nNumber receiving intervention\nNumber of interactions between EIP staff and site staff\nNumber/% of PLWHA not in care (new and previous)\nNumber/% of PLWHA linked to medical care and other services\nNumber/% of PLWHA receiving risk assessment and counseling\nNumber of MSM approached\nNumber of MSM receiving intervention\nNumber/% of HIV(-) MSM receiving risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral\nNumber/% of MSM receiving HIV testing\nNumber/% of MSM who test HIV+\nNumber HRHS approached\nNumber receiving intervention\nNumber/% of HIV(-) HRHS receiving risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral\nNumber/% of HRHS receiving HIV testing\nNumber/% HRHS who test HIV+"

This objective has EIP staff identify those either newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed with HIV and determine whether they are out of care, requiring linkage to care services. This objective is inclusive of those who are women of color (WOC), youth (15-29 years old), and injection drug users (IDU). The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below, with the original workplan deliverable crossed out in replace of the updated CTR deliverables:\n\nBy December 31, 2023, EIP will perform 100 risk assessments on PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC site, 15 WCH at site, 5 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site; of which will be 20 WOC, 25 Youth (18-29), and 25 IDU) as prioritized by RFP workplan table\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will perform 125 risk assessments on PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care, inclusive of the following (100 at UCMC site, 15 WCH at site, 5 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site; of which will be 20 WOC, 25 Youth (18-29), and 35 IDU) as prioritized by RFP workplan table\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many PLWHA who are out of care that will be identified by our program, and successfully link 80% of those individuals to care. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nPLWHA are identified in several different ways within the program, including: self-report of a prior positive test during the assessment of HIV testing history, reason for offering an HIV test was due to a prior HIV positive result, declining an HIV test due to prior positive result, a final positive result through HIV testing, or having an HIV linkage case open with a new or previous HIV status. EIP staff are meant to identify all PLWHA encountered through the program, with further follow-up and discussion meant to determine who is currently out of care. The deliverable for all PLWHA identified out of care are those that are “eligible” to be linked to care wihtin the linkage flow process (noted below). They are considered “ineligible” based on the following criteria: they are already linked to care, they are deceased, they are currently incarcerated, we do not have accurate contact information for them, they already have an ongoing linke case for HIV, or they declined EIP linkage services. The numbers provided here are based on the total number of encounters, not unique number of patients, because EIP may encounter individuals frequently throughout the reporting period and identify them as being out of care during any of these encounters.\nThe total number of HIV linkage to care (LTC) cases initiated for PLWHA during this time period is 353, with the total number of “eligible” LTC cases for PLWHA being 89 (25.2% of all HIV LTC cases initiated, 89/353). Therefore, EIP has identified 89 PLWHA for the CTR deliverable, which is 71.2% of the total promise of 125. The total number of these “eligible” HIV LTC cases that have been successfully linked to care is 61, which is 68.5% of those “eligible” (61/89).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not separate linkage numbers based on the HIV testing program (CTR/EHE), so these numbers are pulled the same as the numbers that are reported for the linkage deliverables shown for the EHE program. The difference in the reported numbers are due to the timeframe used for CTR deliverables. Current CTR deliverables are for data collected between 1/1/2023-5/31/2024 and current EHE deliverables are for data collected between 8/1/2023-5/31/2024. The HIV Linkage flow diagram for the CTR deliverable timeframe is shown below to provide an understanding of where the linkage numbers are coming from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional deliverables were made for identifying PLWHA at specific sites where EIP operates. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 67 PLWHA identified at UCMC, which is 67.0% of the total promise of 100. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 8 PLWHA identified at at WCH, which is 53.3% of the total promise of 15. For the community-based tests, there are only deliverables for those CTR tests conducted at the Exchange locations and Talbert locations. For the Exchange locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any location where the Syringe Service Program (SSP) operates. There were a total number of 3 PLWHA identified at Exchange locations, which is 60.0% of the total promise of 5. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 1 PLWHA identified at Talbert locations, which is 20.0% of the total promise of 5.\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for linkage to care. EIP additionally has deliverables for those who are HIV+ and are also WOC, youth and IDU. For those who are WOC, this is defined as any individual who identifies as female whose race/ethnicity is not ‘White/Caucasian’. There were a total number of 11 PLWHA who were also WOC, which is 44.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 21 PLWHA who were also Youth, which is 84.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population.

The ODH report is divided into two different files, one comprising the aggregate data for testing by site, and the positivity data report by site. The aggregate data is further divided into several tabs, each depending on the site where the test occurred. The aggregate data report is essentially divided by the two ED testing sites (UCMC and WCH), the community sites (termed non-traditional testing venues), and the syringe exchange sites. It also consists of the demographic and population data for those tested at those sites. The positivity report identifies the total number of positive tests done at each site per month. The table to the right shows the total number of EHE tests and the overall positivity rate. The figure below shows the monthly EHE testing numbers.\nIt is important to note that there may be a few duplicated tests due to the transition to the new year, and records being in both the 2023 and 2024 databases if an open linkage case from 2023 is actively being worked in the 2024 database.

They are considered “ineligible” based on the following criteria: they are already linked to care, deceased, currently incarcerated, inaccurate contact information, or they declined EIP linkage services.\nThe total number of HIV linkage to care (LTC) cases initiated for PLWHA during this time period is 209, with the total number of “eligible” LTC cases for PLWHA being 58 (27.8% of all HIV LTC cases initiated, 58/209). Therefore, EIP has identified 58 PLWHA for the EHE deliverable, which is 193.3% of the total promise of 30. The total number of these “eligible” HIV LTC cases that have been successfully linked to care is 36, which is 62.1% of those “eligible” (36/58).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not separate linkage numbers based on the HIV testing program (CTR/EHE), so these numbers are pulled the same as the numbers that are reported for the linkage deliverables for the CTR program. The difference in the reported numbers are due to the timeframe for EHE deliverables, as mentioned in the CTR PLWHA section. Current CTR deliverables are for data collected between 1/1/2023-5/31/2024 and current EHE deliverables are for data collected between 8/1/2023-5/31/2024. The HIV Linkage flow diagram for the EHE deliverable timeframe is shown below to provide an understanding of where the linkage numbers are coming from."

    "text": "MSM\nThere were additional deliverables made for population-based objectives, and the first focuses on those who identify as men who have sex with men (MSM). Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will identify 60 MSM for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide HIV testing to 60 MSM, inclusive of the following (40 UCMC site, 10 WCH site, 10 community/outpatient sites; 40 Youth (18-29), and 10 IDU). EIP will identify 10 HIV(+) MSM for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1). Of note, this does not include MSM PLWHA who are either previously diagnosed or those newly diagnosed by usual ED staff apart from CTR.\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many MSM will be assessed for risk and/or need, and how many MSM will be tested using EHE-funded tests. Additionally, EIP states a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, community sites). Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table in the next section.\nFor those individuals who identify as a male, they are determined to be a MSM if they meet at least one of the following criteria: their sexual orientation is homosexual or bisexual, they report sex with a male or a transgender male within the past year, or they are a PLWHA and their reported risk was MSM. The total number of individuals who are MSM that have been assessed during this time period is 66, which is 110.0% of the total promise of 60.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of individuals who are MSM that have been tested through the EHE program is 9, which is 15.0% of the total promise of 60. In addition to the total number of tests, there were deliverables for the location where those tests were conducted. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those EHE tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED). There were a total number of 0 EHE tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 40. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those EHE tests that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED). There were a total number of 0 EHE tests that were conducted at WCH, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 10. For the community-based tests, this includes all tests that were conducted anywhere EIP operates that does not include one of the EDs (UCMC or WCH). There were a total number of 9 EHE tests that were conducted in the community, which is 90.0% of the total promise of 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the EHE workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 0 EHE tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 10. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the EHE program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the EHE program addresses particular population groups for testing. Within the population of MSM, we additionally have deliverables for youth and IDU. For those that are considered in the youth population, EHE defines those between the age of 18-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 18, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 6 EHE tests where the individual was both MSM/Youth, which is 15.0% of the total promise of 40. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 0 EHE tests where the individual was both MSM/IDU, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 10."

Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2024, UC EIP will identify 450 HRHS for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including 350 UCMC site, 50 WCH site, and 50 community/outpatient sites).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many HRHS will be assessed for risk and/or need, and state a specific number of assessments at each site (UCMC, WCH, community sites).

    "text": "The Epic dashboard for HCV testing went live on January 2nd, 2024. This Epic dashboard lists all University of Cincinnati Medical Center Emergency Department (UCMC ED) based HCV testing ordered, showing the results in real time. EIP staff monitors the HCV dashboard for positive results and approaches patients directly while they are still in the ED, or the hospital, to provide results, education and information for additional testing (if required), as well as linkage to care through UC’s Clinical Pharmacy when appropriate.\nThe total daily testing numbers for HCV Antibody tests (HCV Ab) are shown in the table below, as well as a plot showing the daily trend in testing numbers. The overall HCV Ab positivity rate for the tests included in the HCV Epic Dashboard is described below the plot. The unique number of tests is determined by the Order ID for the test. The test is only included if the Order Status is “Completed” and the Lab Status indicates that it is the “Final Result” and the lab result is provided. The data is manually exported from the Epic HCV Dashboard each week with the data from the prior week by the EIP Data Team, and merged into a single data file used in this analysis, excluding duplicate records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that since the HCV Epic dashboard data is manually extracted from Epic at various times, the total number of tests for the most recent day may not all be counted. For example, if data is pulled in the afternoon, then the tests conducted in the morning are counted, but not tests conducted later in the evening for that day. The day that the data was pulled is noted by the date at the top of this report. Also, depending on when the data was pulled, not all test results are finalized, so the positivity rate and number of positive tests/patients may also be slightly different. However, this should only pertain to the day the data is pulled, and not prior days included in the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of HCV Ab tests since the initiation of the HCV Dashboard is 8125 tests. The total number of positive HCV Ab results is 349 Ab positive tests, which is 4.30% of all HCV Ab tests conducted (349/8125).\nSince EIP is meant to approach each individual that has a reactive HCV Ab test to provide education, the data provided in the remainder of this report will focus on the unique number of patients rather than number of tests, and those patients that were followed up with by our staff and referred to UC’s Clinical Pharmacy. Since the start of the HCV Dashboard, there have been a total of 7931 unique patients that have been tested for HCV Ab, with a total of 332 unique patients that were positive for HCV Ab (4.19% of all patients tested, 332/7931). The unique number of patients tested is determined by the medical record number (MRN) attached to the lab test. The MRN is the identifier used to match back with the EIP REDCap Database to link with the patient’s record to determine follow-up efforts described in the next section.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, there were a total of 349 HCV positive tests, with 332 unique individuals. For EIP follow-up, we will focus on the unique number of patients in in regards to education of results or additional testing needed, and linkage to care efforts. A summary flow diagram for EIP’s follow-up efforts regarding those that are identified HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard is provided below. You can zoom into this flow diagram by clicking on the image.\n\n\n\n\n\n** Unable to match records means that we are unable to match the EIP follow-up data with the data pulled from the Epic HCV Dashboard. The reason(s) for why these records are unable to be matched are: Tested under different MRN than patient record (n = 8).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs already mentioned, there were a total of 332 HCV Ab+ patients from the Epic HCV Dashboard. There were a total of 14 patients (4.2% of all HCV Ab+ patients, 14/332) that currently do not have an EIP record created for follow-up regarding their HCV Ab+ result, which are in the process of being added. Based on further HCH RNA testing or recent medical record review, it is known that 127 patients are currently HCV RNA negative (38.3% of all those identified as HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard, 127/332). While EIP is not calling all those identified as HCV RNA negative to discuss those results due to the additional effort that would be, we do try to notify these patients and provide additional education and interpretation of these results if we catch them while they are still in the ED/hospital. The total number of patients EIP has provided follow-up education after their HCV RNA results negative is 27 patients (21.3% of all those identified as HCV RNA negative, 27/127).\nTherefore, the number of patients who were identified as HCV Ab+ but either are HCV RNA positive or do not have a RNA lab resulted was 191 patients needing follow-up education and referral (57.5% of all those HCV Ab+ from the Epic HCV Dashboard, 191/332). This means that EIP has been unable to follow-up with 102 patients who were HCV Ab+ and need follow-up results/education (53.4% of all those HCV Ab+ from the Epic HCV Dashboard needing follow-up, 102/191)\nOut of those patients that needed follow-up, EIP staff were able to approach and provide results/education to 89 patients (46.6% of all those identified as HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard needing follow-up, 89/191). EIP makes every attempt to approach the patient while they are still located in the ED or admitted to the hospital. The number of patients where EIP was able to initiate face-to-face contact while they were still in the hospital (whether in the ED or roomed elsewhere) was 49 patients (55.1% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 49/89). If EIP is unable to approach patients while they were still in the ED/hospital, then attempts are made to follow-up with them using the contact information collected during ED intake. The number of patients where EIP was able to contact them after discharge was 39 patients (43.8% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 39/89). Additionally, if EIP is aware that an individual was provided with their results, education, and follow-up linkage referral by other staff through their typical ED treatment and care, then we monitor the case rather than direct involvement in order to decrease duplication of work in getting the patient linked to care. The number of patients where EIP was aware that the patient has been referred for HCV treatment by other staff was 1 patients (1.1% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 1/89).\nThe EIP REDCap Database allows for documentation regarding referral to UC Clinical Pharmacy, as well as linkage to other locations that can manage/treat their HCV. The total number of patients that have been linked to care for HCV was 36 patients (40.4% of all those EIP provided education to, 36/89). The number of patients that were linked to care specifically to the UC Clinical Pharmacy was 22 patients (61.1% of all those patients linked to care, 22/36). Once EIP refers a patient to UC Clinical Pharmacy and gets them scheduled, they are documented as linked to care. It is our current process that UC Clinical Pharmacy will manage and follow-up with those individuals who do not successfully attend those appointments, re-linking them as needed. However, our documentation ends once the referral is made and the appointment is scheduled. The number of patients that were linked to care to a location other than the UC Clinical Pharmacy for HCV treatment is 14 patients (38.9% of all those patients linked to care, 14/36).\nAs part of EIP’s follow-up efforts, we try to ensure anyone who is HCV Ab+ has the necessary lab testing to know if they are currently infected with HCV by facilitating RNA testing when appropriate. The total number of patients that had a follow-up RNA test documented within their EIP REDCap record was 247 patients (70.8% of all those HCV Ab+, 247/332). As mentioned above, there were a total of 127 patients that were negative for HCV RNA, which is 38.3% of all those with a known HCV RNA result (127/247). For those patients that were tested for RNA, the total number of those that were found to be true positives for HCV was 116 patients (47.0% of all those tested for HCV RNA, 116/247).\n\n\n\n\nIn order to evaluate whether we have appropriate EIP staff coverage for this project, this section looks at the time that the HCV Ab test results are available and whether there is an EIP staff member dedicated for this project on staff. Therefore, we can know whether our staff is available to approach the patient in the ED/hospital when the lab results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLab Result times.\n\n\n\n\n\nHCV Epic Dashboard dataset does not include Lab Result times. The result times for the labs are estimated using the Order Date/Time of the test and the average resulting time for HCV antibody tests based on CHI lab data.\n\n\n\nThe HCV Dashboard does not include result times for the labs. Therefore, an average HCV Ab lab result time was calculated from CHI HCV Ab lab data and used here (CHI HCV Ab lab result times average is about 3 hours and 53 minutes). The HCV Ab dashboard lab result times were estimated by adding this average lab result time from the CHI lab data onto the Order Date/Time values for the dashboard labs. Since these are estimated lab result times, there is some variability in this data. Also, since these are estimates, EIP staff coverage times are estimated since those can vary slightly week to week.\nSince these lab result times are estimates, they have been categorized into four categories to simplify the plot: Overnight (12am-5:59am), Morning (6am-11:59am), Afternoon (12pm-5:59pm), and Evening (6pm-11:59pm). Employee staff coverage is used an estimated based on these same parameters. Current staff coverage was used based on the staff shift schedule noted below:\n\nRK: Monday-Thursday (7am-5pm; morning-afternoon) or Tuesday-Friday (7am-5pm; morning-afternoon), alternating weeks\nJF: Monday and Friday (10am-10pm; morning-evening) and Tuesday (9am-9pm; morning-evening)\nKA: Wednesday-Sunday (3pm-11pm; afternoon-evening)\n\nTherefore, it is estimated that EIP staff is available for this project during most day/times except for the overnight shifts for each day.\nThe plot below shows the days and time periods of the estimated HCV Ab+ lab result times, as well as the times that there is EIP coverage. The frequency shows the total number of HCV Ab+ results for each day/time since the start of the project. The colored bars indicates that there is EIP staff scheduled during this time to respond to the HCV Dashboard and approach those patients who are HCV Ab+.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below summarizes the total number of HCV Ab+ results where an EIP staff member assigned for this project was on shift, and the percentage of the total HCV Ab+ results. This table indicates that EIP staff was available during 72.8% of the HCV Ab+ labs when they were estimated to have resulted and appear in the HCV Dashboard (254/349). Also, this table shows that EIP staff was not on shift for this project during 27.2% of the HCV Ab+ labs when they were estimated to have resulted (95/349). Reminder: this is looking at the total number of HCV Ab positive tests (n = 349), rather than the unique number of patients positive for HCV Ab (n = 332) as used in the EIP follow-up flow diagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Frequency\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nWith EIP Coverage\n254\n72.8%\n\n\nWithout EIP Coverage\n95\n27.2%"

Current staff coverage was used based on the staff shift schedule noted below:\n\nRK: Monday-Thursday (7am-5pm; morning-afternoon) or Tuesday-Friday (7am-5pm; morning-afternoon), alternating weeks\nJF: Monday and Friday (10am-10pm; morning-evening) and Tuesday (9am-9pm; morning-evening)\nKA: Wednesday-Sunday (3pm-11pm; afternoon-evening)\n\nTherefore, it is estimated that EIP staff is available for this project during most day/times except for the overnight shifts for each day.\nThe plot below shows the days and time periods of the estimated HCV Ab+ lab result times, as well as the times that there is EIP coverage. The frequency shows the total number of HCV Ab+ results for each day/time since the start of the project. The colored bars indicates that there is EIP staff scheduled during this time to respond to the HCV Dashboard and approach those patients who are HCV Ab+.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below summarizes the total number of HCV Ab+ results where an EIP staff member assigned for this project was on shift, and the percentage of the total HCV Ab+ results. This table indicates that EIP staff was available during 72.8% of the HCV Ab+ labs when they were estimated to have resulted and appear in the HCV Dashboard (254/349). Also, this table shows that EIP staff was not on shift for this project during 27.2% of the HCV Ab+ labs when they were estimated to have resulted (95/349). Reminder: this is looking at the total number of HCV Ab positive tests (n = 349), rather than the unique number of patients positive for HCV Ab (n = 332) as used in the EIP follow-up flow diagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Frequency\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nWith EIP Coverage\n254\n72.8%\n\n\nWithout EIP Coverage\n95\n27.2%"

    "text": "Screening for HT\nEIP officially began screening for human trafficking (HT) within the EIP Database as of December 1st, 2022 with the introduction of Dr. Christa Pulvino’s pilot grant. The EIP assessment has had some general questions that may indicate the risk of an individual being in a HT situation, but new assessment questions were added to indicate a risk for trafficking, as well as the HPA’s general impression of whether the individual was at risk based on additional information. Additional resources for HT were included within the EIP list, and a new, electronic version of the EIP resource list was created that allowed the ability for patients to access the list of EIP resources using a QR code. The data captured for this project is provided on this page, along with additional data that pertains to the HT efforts within EIP.\nThere are a total of 8263 encounters with EIP, with a total of 3169 assessments completed (38.4% of the total number of encounters). As mentioned above, there are several questions within the EIP assessment that may indicate whether someone is in an at-risk situation for HT. The total number of assessments where at least one of these questions was asked and answered is 2071 (65.4% of the total number of assessments, 2071/3169). The questions that are included in the total assessed for HT (in addition to the questions provided by Dr. Pulvino) are noted below:\n\nWhen did you last receive money and/or drugs for sex?\nDo you feel safe in your relationship?\nDoes your partner pressure you into having sex?\n\nHowever, when we only consider those questions that were included with Dr. Pulvino’s HT assessment, the number of assessments where this specific screening was done was 1178 (37.2% of the total number of assessments, 1178/3169). Individuals are considered at risk for HT if they respond ‘Yes’ to any of the questions in this HT assessment. The total number of assessments where an individual screened positive for HT risk is 159 (13.5% of the total assessed using Dr. Pulvino’s assessment, 159/1178). The summary table for HT screening is provided below.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    HT Assessed \n    % Assessed \n    HT Assessed (Pulvino) \n    % Assessed (Pulvino) \n    Screened HT+ \n    % HT+ \n  \n \n\n  \n    2071 \n    65.4% \n    1178 \n    37.2% \n    159 \n    13.5% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe breakdown of the responses for each question on Dr. Pulvino’s HT assessment are provided in the table below to keep track of which specific questions are being asked and answered, and which ones are of highest note for those who are screening positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, EIP has asked whether an individual has exchanged money and/or drugs for sex. However, these are asked in conjunction with Dr. Pulvino’s question of whether they have ever received anything for sex, not just money or drugs. The response to Dr. Pulvino’s specific question is shown above, but we can also look at the total number of assessments where the individual endorsed receiving anything for sex, whether it was a response to the historical EIP question(s) or the additional question provided by Dr. Pulvino. Looking at the response to all questions related to receiving anything for sex, there were a total of 201 assessments where the individual endorsed receiving anything for sex (10% of all those assessed for HT, 201/2071).\nAdditional questions that can be evaluated in identifying the risk for HT are whether an individual feels safe in their relationship and whether their partner pressures them into having sex. There were a total number of 1227 assessments where the individual answered the question regarding feeling safe in their relationship, with 151 (12% of all those assessed for this question, 151/1227) stating they do not feel safe in their current relationship. There were a total number of 1145 assessments where the individual answered the question regarding being pressured into sex by their partner, with 52 (5% of all those assessed for this question, 52/1145) stating that they have been pressured into sex by their partner.\nAdditionally, the EIP staff are asked to document during their encounter whether they had a feeling of whether the individual was a potential risk for HT, regardless of how they answered the questions and based on their overall impression of the encounter as a whole. There were a total of 42 encounters where the EIP staff indicated that they had a feeling the individual was at risk for being trafficked (0.5% of all encounters, 42/8263). The total number of encounters is used as the denominator here (rather than the number of assessments, or those screened for HT risk) because the EIP staff can note their impression of HT risk without completing an assessment. However, we can also look at this total for those that completed an assessment and those that completed HT screening if desired. When looking at it this way, 1.3% of those that completed an EIP assessment were suspected of being in a trafficking situation by the EIP staff (42/3169), while 2.0% of those who were screened for HT were suspected of being in a trafficked situation (42/2071).\nFor individuals who screened positive for being a HT risk through Dr. Pulvino’s questions, there were 35 assessments where the EIP staff also stated they had the impression that the individual was at risk for being trafficked (22.0% of all those who screened positive for HT, 35/159). There were a total of 1019 assessments where the individual was screened using Dr. Pulvino’s assessment but did not screen positive, and 3 of these where the EIP staff suspected that they may be at risk (0.3% of all those assessed for HT but were not positive, 3/1019).\n\n\nResources for HT\nReferrals to resources for HT are provided by our EIP health promotion advocates (HPAs) after their encounter with the individual. These resources can be provided whether the individual is screened for their risk of HT or not, and can occur at any time during the individual’s encounter within the emergency department. The total number of encounters where resources were provided to the individual by our HPAs was 1572 (19.0% of all encounters, 1572/8263). In order to ensure that all individuals who are screened, and that screened positive, are able to receive the reosurces they need during that encounter. The total number of encounters where the individual screened positive for HT risk and were provided with resources specifically for HT was 85 (53.5% of all those that screened positive, 85/159). Also, when one of our EIP HPAs suspect HT risk, whether they screened positive or not, they are trained to offer resources that may help. The number of encounters where the individual was suspected of being in a trafficked situation by an EIP HPA and where they were provided with referrals was 35 (83.3% of all those that were suspected of HT risk, 35/42). Finally, the number of encounters where an individual was suspected or screened positive for HT during the assessment and was provided resources was 30 (85.7% of all those that were either suspected of or screened positive for HT risk, 30/35).\n\n\nHT Linkage to Care\nThe flowchart of the HT Linkage to Care efforts for EIP are shown below.

This electronic version of the EIP resource list went live on April 19th, 2023. With this electronic version, we are able to analyze which resources visitors review for our services provided in the document, based on what options they select when triggering the QR code. There were a total of 138 queries into the EIP resource list using this QR code, and the particular services they reviewed are shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the number of views for each service alone, providing the percentage of the the total number of views (n = 138) for the EIP resource list. In addition, the table provides numbers when considering the times that the individual selected to view all services, since the same resources for the individualized service would be accessible when viewing all services. Therefore, the percentage of the total for each service when combined with the number of views for all services is also shown."

    "section": "Objective 1",
    "text": "Objective 1\nThe first objective on the 2023 NACCHO 2.0 workplan has both operational components and data that can be evaluated. Objective 1 for the NACCHO 2.0 grant was Perform follow-up calls to patients with OUD that have been seen in the ED to determine rates of follow-up to treatment facilities. Specifically, objective 1c encompasses the data component and states that we will “Conduct follow-up calls for all people with OUD seen in the ED.” Therefore, we can look at the total number of individuals that screen positive at UCMC ED using the NIDA-Modified ASSIST tool used in the EIP assessment, and how many of those individuals are followed-up with after their encounter to determine engagement in treatment. Also, for Objective 1 under the sustainability component, it discusses the importance of peer involvement, so we can also analyze the number of these OUD screening encounters where a peer is involved.\nFor screening for SUD/OUD within EIP, the NIDA-Modified ASSIST is used and is located within the overall EIP assessment. For this project, we also added the NM-ASSIST to the Linkage to Care page so that NACCHO staff involved with follow-ups can complete the screening tools for those who endorse opioid use but did not have a complete assessment to determine whether they meet criteria for OUD. Therefore, when providing numbers for screening and positivity, this includes both ASSIST tools. The total number of patients that received a SUD assessment was 1011 patients (36.4% of all patients, 1011/2775), with a total of 365 that screened positive for any type of SUD (36.1% of all those assessed for SUD, 365/1011). The total number of patients that screened positive specifically for OUD (street/prescription opioids) was 92 (25.2% of all those SUD positive, 92/365), which is 3.3% of all patients seen during this project (92/2775).\nTherefore, there are a total of 92 patients that are eligible for follow-up for this NACCHO 2.0 grant. The total number of patients where contact was attempted was 55 (59.8% of all those OUD positive, 55/92). The initial contact is 14 days after their ED encounter. The total number of contact attempts made at day 14 was 32 (58.2% of all contact attempts, 32/55). If contact at day 14 was unsuccessful, or not initiated, then contact was made at day 15, and the total number of patients who were attempted to contact at day 15 was 0 (0.0% of all contact attempts, 0/55). If contact at day 15 was unsuccessful, or not initiated, then contact was made at day 16, and the total number of patients who were attempted to contact at day 16 was 0 (0.0% of all contact attempts, 0/55). If contact at day 16 was unsuccessful, or not initiated, then contact was suspended until day 30, and the total number of patients who were attempted to contact at day 30 was 0 (0.0% of all contact attempts, 0/55). If contact at day 30 was unsuccessful, or not initiated, then contact was made at day 31, and the total number of patients who were attempted to contact at day 31 was 0 (0.0% of all contact attempts, 0/55). If contact at day 31 was unsuccessful, or not initiated, then contact was made at day 32, and the total number of patients who were attempted to contact at day 32 was 0 (0.0% of all contact attempts, 0/55).\nOut of the total number of patients that screened positive for OUD (92 patients), there were a total of 26 patients that were successfully contacted (47.3% of all those where contact was attempted, 26/55). The total number of successful contact attempts made at day 14 was 18 (69.2% of all successful contact attempts, 18/26). The total number of patients who were successfully contacted at day 15 was 0 (0.0% of all successful contact attempts, 0/26). The total number of patients who were successfully contacted at day 16 was 0 (0.0% of all successful contact attempts, 0/26). The total number of patients who were successfully contacted at day 30 was 0 (0.0% of all successful contact attempts, 0/26). The total number of patients who were successfully contacted at day 31 was 0 (0.0% of all successful contact attempts, 0/26). The total number of patients who were successfully contacted at day 32 was 0 (0.0% of all successful contact attempts, 0/26).\nFinally, NACCHO staff are meant to confirm whether the individual is established with treatment for OUD. For all of those individuals where our NACCHO staff was able to successfully make contact, they have been able to confirm that 7 patients are established with treatment for OUD (26.9% of all successful contact attempts, 7/26), which is 7.6% of all patients that screened positive for an OUD."

More specifically, the individual is asked whether they are aware of tools used to test drugs for the presence of fentanyl, meaning their knowledge of fentanyl test strips (FTS). This assessment of their knowledge of harm reduction tools is available for all those receiving an EIP assessment, regardless of any indication of their own history of substance use. The total number of assessments where this question was answered was 773 (24.4% of all assessments completed, 773/3169). This question asks for a yes/no response, and the total number of assessments where the indiviudal responded that they were aware of FTS was 394 (51.0% of all those asked about their knowledge of FTS, 394/773). If they stated that they were aware of FTS, the indiviudal is then asked about their prior use of these harm reduction tools. The total number of assessments where the individual stated that they were aware of FTS that answered this follow-up question was 344 (87.3% of all assessments where the individual was aware of FTS, 344/394). Again, this is a yes/no response, and the total number of assessments where the individual stated that they have used FTS before was 193 (56.1% of all assessments where the individual was asked about prior FTS use, 193/344).\nFor those individuals that screened positive for any type of SUD through the EIP assessment, the number of assessments where they were also assessed for their knowledge of FTS was 313 (38.1% of all SUD positive assessments, 313/821), with 171 stating that they were aware of FTS (54.6% of all SUD positive assessments where the individual was also assessed for FTS knowledge, 171/313). The number of assessments where the individual screened positive for any SUD where they were also assessed for their prior use of FTS was 162 (94.7% of all SUD positive assessments that were aware of FTS, 162/171), with 91 endorsing prior use of FTS (56.2% of all SUD positive assessments also assessed for prior FTS use, 91/162).\nDuring each encounter, individuals are also offered these harm reduction tools and provided with FTS if they are interested in receiving them at that time. The number of assessments where individuals who were asked whether they would be interested in recieving FTS was 797 (25.1% of all assessments, 797/3169), with 358 stating that they were interested (44.9% of all assessed for interest in receiving FTS, 358/797). Once they stated that they had an interst in recieving FTS during their encounter, the HPA documents whether they were able to provide the individual with FTS and how many they were given for reporting purposes. The number of times the individual was provided with FTS during their encounter was 338 (94.4% of all times when the individual stated interest in receiving FTS, 338/358).\nFor those that screened positive for any type of SUD during their encounter, the number of assessments where individuals who were asked whether they would be interested in recieving FTS was 314 (38.2% of all assessments where the individual screened positive for a SUD, 314/821), with 156 stating that they were interested (49.7% of all SUD positive assessments also assessed for interest in receiving FTS, 156/314). The number of times where the individual screened positive for a SUD and was provided with FTS during their encounter was 148 (94.9% of all times when the individual screened SUD positive and stated interest in receiving FTS, 148/156).\nThe total number of FTS distributed is reported on a monthly basis required for being a Project Dawn site, starting August 1st, 2023. Therefore, the total number of strips distributed are counted on a monthly basis and provided in the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the number represented here is the number of individual strips, not the number of kits. Standard FTS kits are in packages of 5 strips, and the EIP HPA can select this as an option when documenting the distribution of FTS to individuals. However, they are also able to document non-standard amounts that are distributed in a free text field. Therefore, anytime they select that they distributed the standard kit of 5 strips, this is counted as five individual strips and combined with the free text field of non-standard distribution.\n\n\n\n\nWork in progress\nNaloxone distribution is documented in two different programs within EIP: (1) direct naloxone distribution of kits provided through grants, and (2) facilitated distribution where EIP prompts medical staff to distribute naloxone from the Omnicell within UCMC and WCH EDs after discussion with the patient. The two programs will be discussed separately below. Also, the number of kits distributed from the UCMC and WCH Omnicells will be provided with the direct distribution information because those numbers are reported alongside the distribution of our EIP kits.\nWith Project Dawn naloxone distribution, there are three different “versions” or methods of distribution that are recorded: (1) Individual distribution, (2) Transfer to an agency, and (3) Overdose Awareness Day and Recovery Month Event. For each of these versions of distribution, there are different data points collected and required for reporting. Individual distribution is when we provide naloxone kits to an individual person, and we collect data regarding their demographics, area in which they live, and past history with overdose and naloxone use. Transfer to an agency is when we provide a batch of kits for an agency for them to distribute on their own, and we just document how many kits were provided to them, but no additional information is collected as with individual distributions. Finally, Overdose Awareness Day (OAD) and Recovery month events are any combination of the first two versions, only that they must occur on OAD (August 31st) or during recovery month (September 30th). With this version, we also only collect specifics about the setting of the distribution and the total number of kits, but not information about the individual receiving the naloxone kit(s). The table below shows the total number of distribution events (not number of kits) for each of these types of distribution versions.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    Total distribution events \n  \n \n\n  \n    Individual Distribution \n    643 \n  \n  \n    Transfer to an Agency \n    15 \n  \n  \n    OAD & Recovery Month \n    122 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally for transferring kits to an agency, Project Dawn asks for additional information regarding the type of transfer. There are three transfer types: (1) One-time partner for distribution, (2) Service entity first aid, and (3) Public NaloxBox/cabinet. The table below shows the number of distribution events (not number of kits) involving a transfer of kits to an agency for each of these transfer types.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    Total distribution events \n  \n \n\n  \n    One-time partner for distribution \n    12 \n  \n  \n    Service entity first aid \n    3 \n  \n  \n    Public NaloxBox/cabinet \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot below shows the monthly naloxone kit distributions, which are the numbers reported to ODH each month. This plot shows how many kits were distributed by EIP through various community engagements (regular sites and/or special events) as well as the number of kits that are distributed through UCMC and WCH ED through the Omnicell each month."

    "text": "During the EIP assessment and discussion with the patient/client, the HPA asks questions regarding the individual’s knowledge of harm reduction tools. More specifically, the individual is asked whether they are aware of tools used to test drugs for the presence of fentanyl, meaning their knowledge of fentanyl test strips (FTS). This assessment of their knowledge of harm reduction tools is available for all those receiving an EIP assessment, regardless of any indication of their own history of substance use. The total number of assessments where this question was answered was 773 (24.4% of all assessments completed, 773/3169). This question asks for a yes/no response, and the total number of assessments where the indiviudal responded that they were aware of FTS was 394 (51.0% of all those asked about their knowledge of FTS, 394/773). If they stated that they were aware of FTS, the indiviudal is then asked about their prior use of these harm reduction tools.

There are different reports required to the local health department, Hamilton County Public Health (HCPH), and to the state health department, Ohio Department of Health (ODH). The report for HCPH is due by the 5th of the month for the prior month’s testing data. This report includes the total number of CTR-funded tests performed, how many were reactive (and then confirmed positive), and whether those positive tests were for patients newly-diagnosed or for a person known to be living with HIV. Additionally, the total number of assessments conducted, and how many individuals were tested and assessed are reported to HCPH each month for CTR. The report sent to ODH each month consists of the total number of CTR-funded tests, and how many individuals were newly diagnosed with HIV from testing. Additionally, the ODH report consists of the assessment data for each negative test, only providing the ODH assessment questions. The ODH report is divided into three parts: 1) the number of tests and assessment data for all those testing negative, 2) the opscan data for all those testing negative, 3) the supplemental opscan data for those that were tested but did not have an assessment conducted at the time of the test.

The original workplan specified data that was collected starting January 1st, 2023 through December 31, 2023. However, an update with funding allocation for both the CTR and EHE programs allowed for a change to the deliverables for CTR and the timeframe for those deliverables. The data in the table to the right shows the deliervables that were updated based on this change. The changes in these deliverables were made based on the estimated possibility of reaching these goals based on the numbers we had reached at the time the changes were initiated. For example, some of the deliverables were already met, so those numbers were increased due to the likelihood of surpassing the original goal; some deliverables were close to being met, so they may have been increased slightly; and some deliverables were not close to being met, so they were not changed in the hopes that we would be able to meet those original goals by the new extended timeframe. The updates in these deliverable goals were made on December 18th, 2023. The table to the right only shows those deliverables that were updated, and all other deliverables are the same as the original deliverables set in the 2023 workplan.\nThe data shown in the table below covers the updated CTR program deliverables starting January 1st, 2023 through July 31, 2024 in accordance with those workplan updates. A summary table of the CTR deliverables, the number of each deliverable achieved, and the percent of the deliverables met are shown below:\n\n\nWarning: 'xfun::attr()' is deprecated.\nUse 'xfun::attr2()' instead.\nSee help(\"Deprecated\")\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    CTR Deliverable \n    Achieved \n    Goal \n    % \n  \n \n\n  PLWHA\n\n    PLWHA not in care \n    107 \n    125 \n    85.6% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA at UCMC \n    79 \n    100 \n    79.0% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA at WCH \n    8 \n    15 \n    53.3% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA at the Exchange \n    4 \n    5 \n    80.0% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA at Talbert \n    1 \n    5 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA/WOC \n    7 \n    25 \n    28.0% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA/Youth \n    25 \n    25 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    PLWHA/IDU \n    23 \n    35 \n    65.7% \n  \n  \n    % PLWHA linked \n    65.4% \n    80% \n     \n  \n  MSM\n\n    MSM assessed \n    164 \n    140 \n    117.1% \n  \n  \n    MSM tested \n    76 \n    100 \n    76.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM tested at UCMC \n    45 \n    75 \n    60.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM tested at WCH \n    2 \n    10 \n    20.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM tested at the Exchange \n    18 \n    10 \n    180.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM tested at Talbert \n    5 \n    5 \n    100.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM/Youth tested \n    32 \n    25 \n    128.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM/IDU tested \n    23 \n    25 \n    92.0% \n  \n  \n    MSM new positive \n    7 \n    3 \n    233.3% \n  \n  HRHS\n\n    HRHS assessed \n    1177 \n    1150 \n    102.3% \n  \n  \n    HRHS tested \n    677 \n    900 \n    75.2% \n  \n  \n    HRHS tested at UC \n    467 \n    550 \n    84.9% \n  \n  \n    HRHS tested at WCH \n    6 \n    100 \n    6.0% \n  \n  \n    HRHS tested at the Exchange \n    132 \n    150 \n    88.0% \n  \n  \n    HRHS tested at Talbert \n    49 \n    100 \n    49.0% \n  \n  \n    HRHS/WOC tested \n    160 \n    130 \n    123.1% \n  \n  \n    HRHS/Youth tested \n    238 \n    200 \n    119.0% \n  \n  \n    HRHS/IDU tested \n    205 \n    300 \n    68.3% \n  \n  \n    HRHS new positive \n    7 \n    9 \n    77.8% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first impact objective encompasses population-based objectives centered around people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) that are identified not in care. This objective has EIP staff identify those either newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed with HIV and determine whether they are out of care, requiring linkage to care services. This objective is inclusive of those who are women of color (WOC), youth (15-29 years old), and injection drug users (IDU). The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below, with the original workplan deliverable crossed out in replace of the updated CTR deliverables:\n\nBy December 31, 2023, EIP will perform 100 risk assessments on PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC site, 15 WCH at site, 5 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site; of which will be 20 WOC, 25 Youth (18-29), and 25 IDU) as prioritized by RFP workplan table\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will perform 125 risk assessments on PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care, inclusive of the following (100 at UCMC site, 15 WCH at site, 5 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site; of which will be 20 WOC, 25 Youth (18-29), and 35 IDU) as prioritized by RFP workplan table\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many PLWHA who are out of care that will be identified by our program, and successfully link 80% of those individuals to care. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nPLWHA are identified in several different ways within the program, including: self-report of a prior positive test during the assessment of HIV testing history, reason for offering an HIV test was due to a prior HIV positive result, declining an HIV test due to prior positive result, a final positive result through HIV testing, or having an HIV linkage case open with a new or previous HIV status. EIP staff are meant to identify all PLWHA encountered through the program, with further follow-up and discussion meant to determine who is currently out of care. The deliverable for all PLWHA identified out of care are those that are “eligible” to be linked to care wihtin the linkage flow process (noted below). They are considered “ineligible” based on the following criteria: they are already linked to care, they are deceased, they are currently incarcerated, we do not have accurate contact information for them, they already have an ongoing linke case for HIV, or they declined EIP linkage services. The numbers provided here are based on the total number of encounters, not unique number of patients, because EIP may encounter individuals frequently throughout the reporting period and identify them as being out of care during any of these encounters.\nThe total number of HIV linkage to care (LTC) cases initiated for PLWHA during this time period is 403, with the total number of “eligible” LTC cases for PLWHA being 107 (26.6% of all HIV LTC cases initiated, 107/403). Therefore, EIP has identified 107 PLWHA for the CTR deliverable, which is 85.6% of the total promise of 125. The total number of these “eligible” HIV LTC cases that have been successfully linked to care is 70, which is 65.4% of those “eligible” (70/107).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not separate linkage numbers based on the HIV testing program (CTR/EHE), so these numbers are pulled the same as the numbers that are reported for the linkage deliverables shown for the EHE program. The difference in the reported numbers are due to the timeframe used for CTR deliverables. Current CTR deliverables are for data collected between 1/1/2023-5/31/2024 and current EHE deliverables are for data collected between 8/1/2023-5/31/2024. The HIV Linkage flow diagram for the CTR deliverable timeframe is shown below to provide an understanding of where the linkage numbers are coming from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional deliverables were made for identifying PLWHA at specific sites where EIP operates. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 79 PLWHA identified at UCMC, which is 79.0% of the total promise of 100. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 8 PLWHA identified at at WCH, which is 53.3% of the total promise of 15. For the community-based tests, there are only deliverables for those CTR tests conducted at the Exchange locations and Talbert locations. For the Exchange locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any location where the Syringe Service Program (SSP) operates. There were a total number of 4 PLWHA identified at Exchange locations, which is 80.0% of the total promise of 5. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 1 PLWHA identified at Talbert locations, which is 20.0% of the total promise of 5.\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for linkage to care. EIP additionally has deliverables for those who are HIV+ and are also WOC, youth and IDU. For those who are WOC, this is defined as any individual who identifies as female whose race/ethnicity is not ‘White/Caucasian’. There were a total number of 7 PLWHA who were also WOC, which is 28.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 25 PLWHA who were also Youth, which is 100.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 23 PLWHA who were also IDU, which is 65.7% of the total promise of 35.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were additional deliverables made for population-based objectives, and the first focuses on those who identify as men who have sex with other men (MSM). Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below, with the original workplan deliverable crossed out in replace of the updated CTR deliverables:\n\nBy December 31, 2023, EIP will identify 100 MSM for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 100 MSM, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC site, 10 at WCH site, 10 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site ; of which will be 20 Youth (15-29) and 20 IDU). Of the 100 MSM tested, EIP will identify between 3-5 HIV(+) MSM for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will identify 140 MSM for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 100 MSM, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC site, 10 at WCH site, 10 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site ; of which will be 25 Youth (15-29) and 25 IDU). Of the 100 MSM tested, EIP will identify between 3-5 HIV(+) MSM for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many MSM will be assessed for risk and/or need, and how many MSM will be tested using CTR-funded tests. Additionally, EIP states a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, the Exchange, and Talbert). EIP also states how many MSM will be tested using CTR-funded tests who are also youth (15-29) and injection drug users (IDU), as well as a specific number of newly diagnosed individuals who identify as MSM. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nFor those individuals who identify as a male, they are determined to be a MSM if they meet at least one of the following criteria: they identify as Male and their sexual orientation is homosexual or bisexual, they report sex with a male or a transgender male within the past year, or they are a PLWHA and their reported risk was MSM. The total number of individuals who are MSM that have been assessed during this time period is 164, which is 117.1% of the total promise of 140.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of individuals who are MSM that have been tested through the CTR program is 76, which is 76.0% of the total promise of 100. In addition to the total number of tests, there were deliverables for the location where those tests were conducted. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 45 CTR tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 60.0% of the total promise of 75. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 2 CTR tests that were conducted at WCH, which is 20.0% of the total promise of 10. For the community-based tests, there are only deliverables for those CTR tests conducted at the Exchange locations and Talbert locations. For the Exchange locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any location where the Syringe Service Program (SSP) operates. There were a total number of 18 CTR tests that were conducted at Exchange locations, which is 180.0% of the total promise of 10. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 5 CTR tests that were conducted at Talbert locations, which is 100.0% of the total promise of 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the CTR workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals who identify as MSM who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 7 MSM CTR tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 233.3% of the total promise of 3. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the CTR program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be further broken down monthly to determine how frequently we test those who identify as MSM, and determine if program evaluation needs to occur based on how we can increase testing for this population or whether decreased testing numbers are due to staffing changes and program barriers. The monthly breakdown of MSM CTR testing by month is shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for testing. Within the population of MSM, we additionally have deliverables for youth and IDU. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 32 CTR tests where the individual was both MSM/Youth, which is 128.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 23 CTR tests where the individual was both MSM/IDU, which is 92.0% of the total promise of 25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were additional deliverables made for population-based objectives, and the second focuses on those who identify as heterosexual that are at high risk for contracting HIV by endorsing high-risk heterosexual sex (HRHS) behaviors. Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy December 31, 2023, EIP will identify 1000 HRHS for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 900 HRHS, inclusive of the following (550 UCMC at site, 100 WCH at site, 150 at Exchange site, 100 Talbert at House facility site; of which will be 100 WOC, 200 Youth (15-29), and 300 IDU). Of the 900 HRHS tested, EIP will identify 9 HIV(+) HRHS for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will identify 1150 HRHS for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 900 HRHS, inclusive of the following (550 UCMC at site, 100 WCH at site, 150 at Exchange site, 100 Talbert at House facility site; of which will be 130 WOC, 200 Youth (15-29), and 300 IDU). Of the 900 HRHS tested, EIP will identify 9 HIV(+) HRHS for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many HRHS will be assessed for risk and/or need, how many HRHS individuals will be tested through CTR-funded tests, and state a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, the Exchange, and Talbert). Additionally, EIP stated specific populations within those who are HRHS, including WOC, youth (15-29), and IDU. EIP also stated a specific number of individuals newly diagnosed with HIV through CTR testing. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nFor those individuals who identify as a heterosexual (men who have sex with women, or women who have sex with men), they are determined to be HRHS if they meet at least one of the following criteria: heterosexual women that have unprotected sex with men or MSM, heterosexual men/women that have sex with an IDU, an HIV positive partner, a STD positive partner, more than three partners, or heterosexual men/women that exchange money/drugs for sex. These behaviors are all within the past year.\nThe total number of encounters with individuals who are HRHS that have been assessed during this time period is 1177, which is 102.3% of the total promise of 1150. In addition to the total number of assessments, there were deliverables for the number of CTR-funded tests performed. The total number of encounters where HRHS individuals were tested is 677, which is 75.2% of the total promise of 900. There were also deliverables for the number of tests performed at specific sites where EIP operates. For UCMC, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by a CTR test that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 467 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 84.9% of the total promise of 550. For WCH, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by a CTR test that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 6 CTR HRHS assessments that were conducted at WCH, which is 6.0% of the total promise of 100. For the community-based tests, this includes those CTR-funded tests that were conducted at either the Exchange or Talbert sites. For the Exchange, this includes any site where the SSP operates.

According to the CTR workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals that are HRHS who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 7 HRHS CTR tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 77.8% of the total promise of 9. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the CTR program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be further broken down monthly to determine how frequently we test those who are HRHS, and determine if program evaluation needs to occur based on how we can increase testing for this population or whether decreased testing numbers are due to staffing changes and program barriers.

Within the population of HRHS, we additionally have deliverables for WOC, youth and IDU. For those who are WOC, this is defined as any individual who identifies as female whose race/ethnicity is not ‘White/Caucasian’. There were a total number of 160 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/WOC, which is 123.1% of the total promise of 130. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 238 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/Youth, which is 119.0% of the total promise of 200. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 205 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/IDU, which is 68.3% of the total promise of 300.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional metrics still to code for:\n\nNumber of PLWHA approached\nNumber receiving intervention\nNumber of interactions between EIP staff and site staff\nNumber/% of PLWHA not in care (new and previous)\nNumber/% of PLWHA linked to medical care and other services\nNumber/% of PLWHA receiving risk assessment and counseling\nNumber of MSM approached\nNumber of MSM receiving intervention\nNumber/% of HIV(-) MSM receiving risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral\nNumber/% of MSM receiving HIV testing\nNumber/% of MSM who test HIV+\nNumber HRHS approached\nNumber receiving intervention\nNumber/% of HIV(-) HRHS receiving risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral\nNumber/% of HRHS receiving HIV testing\nNumber/% HRHS who test HIV+"

    "text": "The first impact objective encompasses population-based objectives centered around people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) that are identified not in care. This objective has EIP staff identify those either newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed with HIV and determine whether they are out of care, requiring linkage to care services. This objective is inclusive of those who are women of color (WOC), youth (15-29 years old), and injection drug users (IDU). The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below, with the original workplan deliverable crossed out in replace of the updated CTR deliverables:\n\nBy December 31, 2023, EIP will perform 100 risk assessments on PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC site, 15 WCH at site, 5 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site; of which will be 20 WOC, 25 Youth (18-29), and 25 IDU) as prioritized by RFP workplan table\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will perform 125 risk assessments on PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care, inclusive of the following (100 at UCMC site, 15 WCH at site, 5 at Exchange site, 5 at Talbert House facility site; of which will be 20 WOC, 25 Youth (18-29), and 35 IDU) as prioritized by RFP workplan table\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many PLWHA who are out of care that will be identified by our program, and successfully link 80% of those individuals to care. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nPLWHA are identified in several different ways within the program, including: self-report of a prior positive test during the assessment of HIV testing history, reason for offering an HIV test was due to a prior HIV positive result, declining an HIV test due to prior positive result, a final positive result through HIV testing, or having an HIV linkage case open with a new or previous HIV status. EIP staff are meant to identify all PLWHA encountered through the program, with further follow-up and discussion meant to determine who is currently out of care. The deliverable for all PLWHA identified out of care are those that are “eligible” to be linked to care wihtin the linkage flow process (noted below). They are considered “ineligible” based on the following criteria: they are already linked to care, they are deceased, they are currently incarcerated, we do not have accurate contact information for them, they already have an ongoing linke case for HIV, or they declined EIP linkage services. The numbers provided here are based on the total number of encounters, not unique number of patients, because EIP may encounter individuals frequently throughout the reporting period and identify them as being out of care during any of these encounters.\nThe total number of HIV linkage to care (LTC) cases initiated for PLWHA during this time period is 403, with the total number of “eligible” LTC cases for PLWHA being 107 (26.6% of all HIV LTC cases initiated, 107/403). Therefore, EIP has identified 107 PLWHA for the CTR deliverable, which is 85.6% of the total promise of 125. The total number of these “eligible” HIV LTC cases that have been successfully linked to care is 70, which is 65.4% of those “eligible” (70/107).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not separate linkage numbers based on the HIV testing program (CTR/EHE), so these numbers are pulled the same as the numbers that are reported for the linkage deliverables shown for the EHE program. The difference in the reported numbers are due to the timeframe used for CTR deliverables. Current CTR deliverables are for data collected between 1/1/2023-5/31/2024 and current EHE deliverables are for data collected between 8/1/2023-5/31/2024. The HIV Linkage flow diagram for the CTR deliverable timeframe is shown below to provide an understanding of where the linkage numbers are coming from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional deliverables were made for identifying PLWHA at specific sites where EIP operates. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 79 PLWHA identified at UCMC, which is 79.0% of the total promise of 100. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 8 PLWHA identified at at WCH, which is 53.3% of the total promise of 15. For the community-based tests, there are only deliverables for those CTR tests conducted at the Exchange locations and Talbert locations. For the Exchange locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any location where the Syringe Service Program (SSP) operates. There were a total number of 4 PLWHA identified at Exchange locations, which is 80.0% of the total promise of 5. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 1 PLWHA identified at Talbert locations, which is 20.0% of the total promise of 5.\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for linkage to care. EIP additionally has deliverables for those who are HIV+ and are also WOC, youth and IDU. For those who are WOC, this is defined as any individual who identifies as female whose race/ethnicity is not ‘White/Caucasian’. There were a total number of 7 PLWHA who were also WOC, which is 28.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 25 PLWHA who were also Youth, which is 100.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 23 PLWHA who were also IDU, which is 65.7% of the total promise of 35."

The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will identify 30 PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care as prioritized by RFP workplan table. Of note, this number PLWHA includes newly diagnosed positives found by ED staff testing that, while apart from the core CTR, would not be possible absent the existence of the CTR (as detailed in Program Narrative).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many PLWHA who are out of care that will be identified by our program, and successfully link 80% of those individuals to care. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nPLWHA are identified in several different ways within the program, including: self-report of a positive test on assessment of prior HIV testing history, reason for offering an HIV test was due to a prior HIV positive result, declining an HIV test due to prior positive result, a final positive result through HIV testing, or having an HIV linkage case open with a new or previous HIV status. EIP staff are meant to identify all PLWHA encountered through the program, and further follow-up and discussion are meant to determine who is currently out of care. The deliverable for all PLWHA identified out of care are those that are “eligible” to be linked to care. They are considered “ineligible” based on the following criteria: they are already linked to care, deceased, currently incarcerated, inaccurate contact information, or they declined EIP linkage services.\nThe total number of HIV linkage to care (LTC) cases initiated for PLWHA during this time period is 259, with the total number of “eligible” LTC cases for PLWHA being 76 (29.3% of all HIV LTC cases initiated, 76/259). Therefore, EIP has identified 76 PLWHA for the EHE deliverable, which is 253.3% of the total promise of 30. The total number of these “eligible” HIV LTC cases that have been successfully linked to care is 45, which is 59.2% of those “eligible” (45/76).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not separate linkage numbers based on the HIV testing program (CTR/EHE), so these numbers are pulled the same as the numbers that are reported for the linkage deliverables for the CTR program. The difference in the reported numbers are due to the timeframe for EHE deliverables, as mentioned in the CTR PLWHA section. Current CTR deliverables are for data collected between 1/1/2023-5/31/2024 and current EHE deliverables are for data collected between 8/1/2023-5/31/2024. The HIV Linkage flow diagram for the EHE deliverable timeframe is shown below to provide an understanding of where the linkage numbers are coming from."

    "text": "MSM\nThere were additional deliverables made for population-based objectives, and the first focuses on those who identify as men who have sex with men (MSM). Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2024, EIP will identify 60 MSM for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide HIV testing to 60 MSM, inclusive of the following (40 UCMC site, 10 WCH site, 10 community/outpatient sites; 40 Youth (18-29), and 10 IDU). EIP will identify 10 HIV(+) MSM for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1). Of note, this does not include MSM PLWHA who are either previously diagnosed or those newly diagnosed by usual ED staff apart from CTR.\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many MSM will be assessed for risk and/or need, and how many MSM will be tested using EHE-funded tests. Additionally, EIP states a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, community sites). Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table in the next section.\nFor those individuals who identify as a male, they are determined to be a MSM if they meet at least one of the following criteria: their sexual orientation is homosexual or bisexual, they report sex with a male or a transgender male within the past year, or they are a PLWHA and their reported risk was MSM. The total number of individuals who are MSM that have been assessed during this time period is 104, which is 173.3% of the total promise of 60.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of individuals who are MSM that have been tested through the EHE program is 15, which is 25.0% of the total promise of 60. In addition to the total number of tests, there were deliverables for the location where those tests were conducted. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those EHE tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED). There were a total number of 0 EHE tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 40. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those EHE tests that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED). There were a total number of 0 EHE tests that were conducted at WCH, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 10. For the community-based tests, this includes all tests that were conducted anywhere EIP operates that does not include one of the EDs (UCMC or WCH). There were a total number of 15 EHE tests that were conducted in the community, which is 150.0% of the total promise of 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the EHE workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 0 EHE tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 10. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the EHE program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the EHE program addresses particular population groups for testing. Within the population of MSM, we additionally have deliverables for youth and IDU. For those that are considered in the youth population, EHE defines those between the age of 18-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 18, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 8 EHE tests where the individual was both MSM/Youth, which is 20.0% of the total promise of 40. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 1 EHE tests where the individual was both MSM/IDU, which is 10.0% of the total promise of 10."

The report for HCPH is due by the 5th of the month for the prior month’s testing data. This report includes the total number of CTR-funded tests performed, how many were reactive (and then confirmed positive), and whether those positive tests were for patients newly-diagnosed or for a person known to be living with HIV. Additionally, the total number of assessments conducted, and how many individuals were tested and assessed are reported to HCPH each month for CTR. The report sent to ODH each month consists of the total number of CTR-funded tests, and how many individuals were newly diagnosed with HIV from testing. Additionally, the ODH report consists of the record-level assessment data for each negative test, only providing the ODH assessment questions. The ODH report is divided into three parts: 1) the number of tests and assessment data for all those testing negative, 2) the opscan data for all those testing negative, and 3) the supplemental opscan data for those that were tested but did not have an assessment conducted at the time of the test.

This objective has EIP staff identify those either newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed with HIV and determine whether they are currently out of care, requiring linkage to care services. This objective is inclusive of those who are women of color (WOC), youth (15-29 years old), and injection drug users (IDU). The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2025, EIP will perform 125 risk assessments on PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care, inclusive of the following (80 at UCMC site, 10 at WCH site, 5 at the Exchange site, 5 at the Talbert House facility site; of which will be 10 WOC, 25 Youth (18-29), and 30 IDU) as prioritized by RFP workplan table\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many PLWHA who are out of care that will be identified by our program, and successfully link 80% of those individuals to care. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nPLWHA are identified in several different ways within the program, including: self-report of a prior positive test during the assessment of HIV testing history, reason for offering an HIV test was due to a prior HIV positive result, declining an HIV test due to prior positive result, a final positive result through HIV testing, or having an HIV linkage case open with a new or previous HIV status. EIP staff are meant to identify all PLWHA encountered through the program, with further follow-up and discussion meant to determine who is currently out of care. The deliverable for all PLWHA identified out of care are those that are “eligible” to be linked to care within the linkage flow process (diagrammed below). They are considered “ineligible” based on the following criteria: they are already linked to care, they are deceased, they are currently incarcerated, we do not have accurate contact information to follow-up with them, they already have an ongoing linkage case for HIV within the program, or they declined EIP linkage services. These situations are determined “ineligible” linkage cases because of the significant level of barriers our program faces in certain situations, or because they cannot be realistically linked through our linkage process. While it is possible for our team to link individuals to care in some of these cases, as a whole they are termed “ineligible” due to the complexity of their situation. The numbers provided here are based on the total number of encounters, not unique number of patients, because EIP may encounter individuals frequently throughout the reporting period and identify them as being out of care during any of these encounters.\nThe total number of HIV linkage to care (LTC) cases initiated for PLWHA during this time period is 167, with the total number of “eligible” LTC cases for PLWHA being 54 (32.3% of all HIV LTC cases initiated, 54/167). Therefore, EIP has identified 54 PLWHA for the CTR deliverable, which is 43.2% of the total promise of 125. The total number of these “eligible” HIV LTC cases that have been successfully linked to care is 32, which is 59.3% of those “eligible” (32/54).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not separate linkage numbers based on the HIV testing program (CTR/EHE), so these numbers are pulled the same as the numbers that are reported for the linkage deliverables shown for the EHE program. If there are differences in the documented numbers for linkage between these two testing programs, it is likely due to the timeframe used for each program deliverable. The HIV Linkage flow diagram for the CTR deliverable timeframe is shown below to provide an understanding of where the linkage numbers are coming from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional deliverables were made for identifying PLWHA at specific sites where EIP operates. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 43 PLWHA identified at UCMC, which is 53.8% of the total promise of 80. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 2 PLWHA identified at at WCH, which is 20.0% of the total promise of 10. For the community-based tests, there are only deliverables for those CTR tests conducted at the Exchange locations and Talbert locations. For the Exchange locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any location where the Syringe Service Program (SSP) operates. There were a total number of 2 PLWHA identified at Exchange locations, which is 40.0% of the total promise of 5. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 0 PLWHA identified at Talbert locations, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 5. Other community site testing is included in the total number of tests conducted, but not in these particular site-based deliverables. The bullet chart below shows the promised deliverables for each site and our current efforts toward those goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, for this objective regarding PLWHA, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for linkage to care. EIP additionally has deliverables for those who are HIV+ and are also WOC, youth and IDU. For those who are WOC, this is defined as any individual who identifies as female whose race/ethnicity is not ‘White/Caucasian’. There were a total number of 9 PLWHA who were also WOC, which is 90.0% of the total promise of 10. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP can encounter individuals younger than the age of 15 (although rarely), so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 13 PLWHA who were also Youth, which is 52.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their associated risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 10 PLWHA who were also IDU, which is 33.3% of the total promise of 30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the mid-year and end-of-year reports to HCPH for linkage numbers, we report the total number of PLWHA that were out of care, whether newly diagnosed or previously known to be positive. The report independently notes the total number of PLWHA who were new diagnoses or previous diagnoses, and the total. This report also determines the number of cases currently in progress (broken down by new/previous/total), and the number of cases successfully closed (broken down by new/previous/total). For those cases that were closed, we report the total number that were successfully linked to care (broken down by new/previous/total) and the number that were not linked to care (broken down by new/previous/total).

Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2025, EIP will identify 150 MSM for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 100 MSM, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC site, 5 at WCH site, 10 at the Exchange site, 5 at the Talbert House facility site; of which will be 25 Youth (15-29) and 25 IDU). Of the 150 MSM tested, EIP will identify between 3-5 HIV(+) MSM for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many MSM will be assessed for risk and/or need, and how many MSM will be tested using CTR-funded tests. Additionally, EIP states a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, the Exchange, and Talbert). EIP also states how many MSM will be tested using CTR-funded tests who are also youth (15-29) and injection drug users (IDU), as well as a specific number of newly diagnosed individuals who identify as MSM. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nFor those individuals who identify as a male, they are determined to be a MSM if they meet at least one of the following criteria: they identify as Male and their sexual orientation is homosexual or bisexual, they report sex with a male within the past year, or they are a PLWHA and their reported risk was MSM. The total number of individuals who are MSM that have been assessed during this time period is 82, which is 54.7% of the total promise of 150.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of individuals who are MSM that have been tested through the CTR program is 40, which is 40.0% of the total promise of 100. In addition to the total number of tests, there were deliverables for the location where those tests were conducted. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 35 CTR tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 46.7% of the total promise of 75. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 0 CTR tests that were conducted at WCH, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 5. For the community-based tests, there are only deliverables for those CTR tests conducted at the Exchange locations and Talbert locations. For the Exchange locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any location where the Syringe Service Program (SSP) operates. There were a total number of 5 CTR tests that were conducted at Exchange locations, which is 50.0% of the total promise of 10. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 0 CTR tests that were conducted at Talbert locations, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 5. Other community site testing is included in the total number of tests conducted, but not in these particular site-based deliverables. The bullet chart below shows the promised deliverables for each site and our current efforts toward those goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the CTR workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals who identify as MSM who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 4 MSM CTR tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 133.3% of the total promise of 3. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the CTR program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be further broken down monthly to determine how frequently we test those who identify as MSM, and determine if program evaluation needs to occur based on how we can increase testing for this population or whether decreased testing numbers are due to staffing changes and program barriers. The monthly breakdown of MSM CTR testing by month is shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for testing. Within the population of MSM, we additionally have deliverables for youth and IDU. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 16 CTR tests where the individual was both MSM/Youth, which is 64.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 6 CTR tests where the individual was both MSM/IDU, which is 24.0% of the total promise of 25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were additional deliverables made for population-based objectives, and the second focuses on those who identify as heterosexual that are at high risk for contracting HIV by endorsing high-risk heterosexual sex (HRHS) behaviors. Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2025, EIP will identify 1150 HRHS for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 800 HRHS, inclusive of the following (550 at UCMC site, 50 at WCH site, 150 at the Exchange site, 100 at the Talbert House facility site; of which will be 130 WOC, 200 Youth (15-29), and 300 IDU). Of the 800 HRHS tested, EIP will identify 9 HIV(+) HRHS for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many HRHS will be assessed for risk and/or need, how many HRHS individuals will be tested through CTR-funded tests, and state a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, the Exchange, and Talbert). Additionally, EIP stated specific populations within those who are HRHS, including WOC, youth (15-29), and IDU. EIP also stated a specific number of individuals newly diagnosed with HIV through CTR testing. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nFor those individuals who identify as a heterosexual (men who have sex with women, or women who have sex with men), they are determined to be HRHS if they meet at least one of the following criteria: heterosexual women that have unprotected sex with men or MSM, heterosexual men/women that have sex with an IDU, an HIV positive partner, a STD positive partner, more than three partners, or heterosexual men/women that exchange money/drugs for sex. These behaviors are all within the past year.\nThe total number of encounters with individuals who are HRHS that have been assessed during this time period is 335, which is 29.1% of the total promise of 1150. In addition to the total number of assessments, there were deliverables for the number of CTR-funded tests performed. The total number of encounters where HRHS individuals were tested is 238, which is 29.8% of the total promise of 800.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were also deliverables for the number of tests performed at specific sites where EIP operates. For UCMC, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by a CTR test that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 186 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 33.8% of the total promise of 550. For WCH, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by a CTR test that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 1 CTR HRHS assessments that were conducted at WCH, which is 2.0% of the total promise of 50. For the community-based tests, this includes those CTR-funded tests that were conducted at either the Exchange or Talbert sites. For the Exchange, this includes any site where the SSP operates. There were a total number of 43 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at the Exchange, which is 28.7% of the total promise of 150. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 2 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at Talbert, which is 2.0% of the total promise of 100. Other community site testing is included in the total number of tests conducted, but not in these particular site-based deliverables. The bullet chart below shows the promised deliverables for each site and our current efforts toward those goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the CTR workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals that are HRHS who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 1 HRHS CTR tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 11.1% of the total promise of 9. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the CTR program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be further broken down monthly to determine how frequently we test those who are HRHS, and determine if program evaluation needs to occur based on how we can increase testing for this population or whether decreased testing numbers are due to staffing changes and program barriers. The monthly breakdown of HRHS CTR testing by month is shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for testing. Within the population of HRHS, we additionally have deliverables for WOC, youth and IDU. For those who are WOC, this is defined as any individual who identifies as female whose race/ethnicity is not ‘White/Caucasian’. There were a total number of 70 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/WOC, which is 53.8% of the total promise of 130. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 119 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/Youth, which is 59.5% of the total promise of 200. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 53 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/IDU, which is 17.7% of the total promise of 300.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional metrics still to code for:\n\nNumber of PLWHA approached\nNumber receiving intervention\nNumber of interactions between EIP staff and site staff\nNumber/% of PLWHA not in care (new and previous)\nNumber/% of PLWHA linked to medical care and other services\nNumber/% of PLWHA receiving risk assessment and counseling\nNumber of MSM approached\nNumber of MSM receiving intervention\nNumber/% of HIV(-) MSM receiving risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral\nNumber/% of MSM receiving HIV testing\nNumber/% of MSM who test HIV+\nNumber HRHS approached\nNumber receiving intervention\nNumber/% of HIV(-) HRHS receiving risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral\nNumber/% of HRHS receiving HIV testing\nNumber/% HRHS who test HIV+"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The first impact objective encompasses population-based objectives centered around people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) that are identified not to be in care. This objective has EIP staff identify those either newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed with HIV and determine whether they are currently out of care, requiring linkage to care services. This objective is inclusive of those who are women of color (WOC), youth (15-29 years old), and injection drug users (IDU). The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2025, EIP will perform 125 risk assessments on PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care, inclusive of the following (80 at UCMC site, 10 at WCH site, 5 at the Exchange site, 5 at the Talbert House facility site; of which will be 10 WOC, 25 Youth (18-29), and 30 IDU) as prioritized by RFP workplan table\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many PLWHA who are out of care that will be identified by our program, and successfully link 80% of those individuals to care. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nPLWHA are identified in several different ways within the program, including: self-report of a prior positive test during the assessment of HIV testing history, reason for offering an HIV test was due to a prior HIV positive result, declining an HIV test due to prior positive result, a final positive result through HIV testing, or having an HIV linkage case open with a new or previous HIV status. EIP staff are meant to identify all PLWHA encountered through the program, with further follow-up and discussion meant to determine who is currently out of care. The deliverable for all PLWHA identified out of care are those that are “eligible” to be linked to care within the linkage flow process (diagrammed below). They are considered “ineligible” based on the following criteria: they are already linked to care, they are deceased, they are currently incarcerated, we do not have accurate contact information to follow-up with them, they already have an ongoing linkage case for HIV within the program, or they declined EIP linkage services. These situations are determined “ineligible” linkage cases because of the significant level of barriers our program faces in certain situations, or because they cannot be realistically linked through our linkage process. While it is possible for our team to link individuals to care in some of these cases, as a whole they are termed “ineligible” due to the complexity of their situation. The numbers provided here are based on the total number of encounters, not unique number of patients, because EIP may encounter individuals frequently throughout the reporting period and identify them as being out of care during any of these encounters.\nThe total number of HIV linkage to care (LTC) cases initiated for PLWHA during this time period is 167, with the total number of “eligible” LTC cases for PLWHA being 54 (32.3% of all HIV LTC cases initiated, 54/167). Therefore, EIP has identified 54 PLWHA for the CTR deliverable, which is 43.2% of the total promise of 125. The total number of these “eligible” HIV LTC cases that have been successfully linked to care is 32, which is 59.3% of those “eligible” (32/54).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not separate linkage numbers based on the HIV testing program (CTR/EHE), so these numbers are pulled the same as the numbers that are reported for the linkage deliverables shown for the EHE program. If there are differences in the documented numbers for linkage between these two testing programs, it is likely due to the timeframe used for each program deliverable. The HIV Linkage flow diagram for the CTR deliverable timeframe is shown below to provide an understanding of where the linkage numbers are coming from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional deliverables were made for identifying PLWHA at specific sites where EIP operates. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 43 PLWHA identified at UCMC, which is 53.8% of the total promise of 80. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 2 PLWHA identified at at WCH, which is 20.0% of the total promise of 10. For the community-based tests, there are only deliverables for those CTR tests conducted at the Exchange locations and Talbert locations. For the Exchange locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any location where the Syringe Service Program (SSP) operates. There were a total number of 2 PLWHA identified at Exchange locations, which is 40.0% of the total promise of 5. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 0 PLWHA identified at Talbert locations, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 5. Other community site testing is included in the total number of tests conducted, but not in these particular site-based deliverables. The bullet chart below shows the promised deliverables for each site and our current efforts toward those goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, for this objective regarding PLWHA, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for linkage to care. EIP additionally has deliverables for those who are HIV+ and are also WOC, youth and IDU. For those who are WOC, this is defined as any individual who identifies as female whose race/ethnicity is not ‘White/Caucasian’. There were a total number of 9 PLWHA who were also WOC, which is 90.0% of the total promise of 10. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP can encounter individuals younger than the age of 15 (although rarely), so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 13 PLWHA who were also Youth, which is 52.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their associated risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 10 PLWHA who were also IDU, which is 33.3% of the total promise of 30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the mid-year and end-of-year reports to HCPH for linkage numbers, we report the total number of PLWHA that were out of care, whether newly diagnosed or previously known to be positive. The report independently notes the total number of PLWHA who were new diagnoses or previous diagnoses, and the total. This report also determines the number of cases currently in progress (broken down by new/previous/total), and the number of cases successfully closed (broken down by new/previous/total). For those cases that were closed, we report the total number that were successfully linked to care (broken down by new/previous/total) and the number that were not linked to care (broken down by new/previous/total). The table belows shows how these numbers are reported to HCPH at the mid-year and end-of-year reports.\n\n\nWarning: 'xfun::attr()' is deprecated.\nUse 'xfun::attr2()' instead.\nSee help(\"Deprecated\")\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    New Dx # \n    New Dx % \n    Previous Dx # \n    Previous Dx % \n    Total # \n    Total % \n  \n \n\n  \n    # PLWHA Out of Care \n    6 \n     \n    48 \n     \n    54 \n     \n  \n  \n    Cases in Progress \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    6 \n    12.5% \n    6 \n    11.1% \n  \n  \n    Cases Closed \n    6 \n    12.5% \n    42 \n    87.5% \n    48 \n    88.9% \n  \n  \n    Linked to Care \n    6 \n    100.0% \n    26 \n    54.2% \n    32 \n    59.3% \n  \n  \n    Not Linked to Care \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    16 \n    33.3% \n    16 \n    33.3% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAny discrepancies in the total numbers compared to the individual new/previous numbers is likely due to the situation when the HIV status in a linkage case has not yet been determined as a new diagnosis or a previous diagnosis."

Of the 800 HRHS tested, EIP will identify 9 HIV(+) HRHS for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many HRHS will be assessed for risk and/or need, how many HRHS individuals will be tested through CTR-funded tests, and state a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, the Exchange, and Talbert). Additionally, EIP stated specific populations within those who are HRHS, including WOC, youth (15-29), and IDU. EIP also stated a specific number of individuals newly diagnosed with HIV through CTR testing. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nFor those individuals who identify as a heterosexual (men who have sex with women, or women who have sex with men), they are determined to be HRHS if they meet at least one of the following criteria: heterosexual women that have unprotected sex with men or MSM, heterosexual men/women that have sex with an IDU, an HIV positive partner, a STD positive partner, more than three partners, or heterosexual men/women that exchange money/drugs for sex. These behaviors are all within the past year.\nThe total number of encounters with individuals who are HRHS that have been assessed during this time period is 335, which is 29.1% of the total promise of 1150. In addition to the total number of assessments, there were deliverables for the number of CTR-funded tests performed. The total number of encounters where HRHS individuals were tested is 238, which is 29.8% of the total promise of 800.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were also deliverables for the number of tests performed at specific sites where EIP operates. For UCMC, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by a CTR test that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 186 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 33.8% of the total promise of 550. For WCH, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by a CTR test that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 1 CTR HRHS assessments that were conducted at WCH, which is 2.0% of the total promise of 50. For the community-based tests, this includes those CTR-funded tests that were conducted at either the Exchange or Talbert sites. For the Exchange, this includes any site where the SSP operates. There were a total number of 43 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at the Exchange, which is 28.7% of the total promise of 150. For the Talbert locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any Talbert based community site. There were a total number of 2 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at Talbert, which is 2.0% of the total promise of 100. Other community site testing is included in the total number of tests conducted, but not in these particular site-based deliverables. The bullet chart below shows the promised deliverables for each site and our current efforts toward those goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the CTR workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals that are HRHS who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 1 HRHS CTR tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 11.1% of the total promise of 9. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the CTR program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be further broken down monthly to determine how frequently we test those who are HRHS, and determine if program evaluation needs to occur based on how we can increase testing for this population or whether decreased testing numbers are due to staffing changes and program barriers. The monthly breakdown of HRHS CTR testing by month is shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for testing. Within the population of HRHS, we additionally have deliverables for WOC, youth and IDU. For those who are WOC, this is defined as any individual who identifies as female whose race/ethnicity is not ‘White/Caucasian’. There were a total number of 70 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/WOC, which is 53.8% of the total promise of 130. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 119 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/Youth, which is 59.5% of the total promise of 200. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 53 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/IDU, which is 17.7% of the total promise of 300."

The aggregate data is further divided into several tabs, each depending on the site where the test occurred. The aggregate data report is essentially divided by the two ED testing sites (UCMC and WCH), the community sites (termed non-traditional testing venues), and the syringe exchange sites.

    "text": "PLWHA\nThe first impact objective encompasses population-based objectives centered around people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) that are identified not in care. This objective has EIP staff identify those either newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed and determine whether they are out of care and require linkage to care services. This objective is inclusive of those who are women of color (WOC), youth (18-29 years old), and injection drug users (IDU). The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2025, EIP will identify 60 PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care as prioritized by RFP workplan table. Of note, this number PLWHA includes newly diagnosed positives found by ED staff testing that, while apart from the core CTR, would not be possible absent the existence of the CTR (as detailed in Program Narrative).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many PLWHA who are out of care that will be identified by our program, and successfully link 80% of those individuals to care. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nPLWHA are identified in several different ways within the program, including: self-report of a positive test on assessment of prior HIV testing history, reason for offering an HIV test was due to a prior HIV positive result, declining an HIV test due to prior positive result, a final positive result through HIV testing, or having an HIV linkage case open with a new or previous HIV status. EIP staff are meant to identify all PLWHA encountered through the program, and further follow-up and discussion are meant to determine who is currently out of care. The deliverable for all PLWHA identified out of care are those that are “eligible” to be linked to care. They are considered “ineligible” based on the following criteria: they are already linked to care, deceased, currently incarcerated, inaccurate contact information, or they declined EIP linkage services.\nThe total number of HIV linkage to care (LTC) cases initiated for PLWHA during this time period is 167, with the total number of “eligible” LTC cases for PLWHA being 54 (32.3% of all HIV LTC cases initiated, 54/167). Therefore, EIP has identified 54 PLWHA for the EHE deliverable, which is 90.0% of the total promise of 60. The total number of these “eligible” HIV LTC cases that have been successfully linked to care is 32, which is 59.3% of those “eligible” (32/54).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not separate linkage numbers based on the HIV testing program (CTR/EHE), so these numbers are pulled the same as the numbers that are reported for the linkage deliverables shown for the CTR program. If there are differences in the documented numbers for linkage between these two testing programs, it is likely due to the timeframe used for each program deliverable. The HIV Linkage flow diagram for the EHE deliverable timeframe is shown below to provide an understanding of where the linkage numbers are coming from."

Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2025, EIP will identify 80 MSM for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide HIV testing to 30 MSM, inclusive of the following (5 UCMC site, 5 WCH site, 20 community/outpatient sites; 10 Youth (18-29), and 10 IDU). EIP will identify 3 HIV(+) MSM for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1). Of note, this does not include MSM PLWHA who are either previously diagnosed or those newly diagnosed by usual ED staff apart from CTR.\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many MSM will be assessed for risk and/or need, and how many MSM will be tested using EHE-funded tests. Additionally, EIP states a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, community sites). Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table in the next section.\nFor those individuals who identify as a male, they are determined to be a MSM if they meet at least one of the following criteria: their sexual orientation is homosexual or bisexual, they report sex with a male within the past year, or they are a PLWHA and their reported risk was MSM. The total number of individuals who are MSM that have been assessed during this time period is 82, which is 102.5% of the total promise of 80.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of individuals who are MSM that have been tested through the EHE program is 16, which is 53.3% of the total promise of 30. In addition to the total number of tests, there were deliverables for the location where those tests were conducted. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those EHE tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED). There were a total number of 1 EHE tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 20.0% of the total promise of 5.

For the community-based tests, this includes all tests that were conducted anywhere EIP operates that does not include one of the EDs (UCMC or WCH). There were a total number of 15 EHE tests that were conducted in the community, which is 75.0% of the total promise of 20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the EHE workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 0 EHE tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 3. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the EHE program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the EHE program addresses particular population groups for testing.

There were a total number of 9 EHE tests where the individual was both MSM/Youth, which is 90.0% of the total promise of 10. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 2 EHE tests where the individual was both MSM/IDU, which is 20.0% of the total promise of 10."

    "text": "The Epic dashboard for HCV testing went live on January 2nd, 2024. This Epic dashboard lists all University of Cincinnati Medical Center Emergency Department (UCMC ED) based HCV testing ordered, showing the results in real time. EIP staff monitors the HCV dashboard for positive results and approaches patients directly while they are still in the ED, or the hospital, to provide results, education and information for additional testing (if required), as well as linkage to care through UC’s Clinical Pharmacy when appropriate.\nThe total daily testing numbers for HCV Antibody tests (HCV Ab) are shown in the table below, as well as a plot showing the daily trend in testing numbers. The overall HCV Ab positivity rate for the tests included in the HCV Epic Dashboard is described below the plot. The unique number of tests is determined by the Order ID for the test. The test is only included if the Order Status is “Completed” and the Lab Status indicates that it is the “Final Result” and the lab result is provided. The data is manually exported from the Epic HCV Dashboard each week with the data from the prior week by the EIP Data Team, and merged into a single data file used in this analysis, excluding duplicate records.\n\nDailyMonthly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that since the HCV Epic dashboard data is manually extracted from Epic at various times, the total number of tests for the most recent day/month may not all be counted. For example, if data is pulled in the afternoon, then the tests conducted in the morning are counted, but not tests conducted later in the evening for that day. The day that the data was pulled is noted by the date at the top of this report. Also, depending on when the data was pulled, not all test results are finalized, so the positivity rate and number of positive tests/patients may also be slightly different. However, this should only pertain to the day the data is pulled, and not prior days included in the analysis.\nThe total number of HCV Ab tests since the initiation of the HCV Dashboard is 32072 tests. The total number of positive HCV Ab results is 1456 Ab positive tests, which is 4.54% of all HCV Ab tests conducted (1456/32072).\nSince EIP is meant to approach each individual that has a reactive HCV Ab test to provide education, the data provided in the remainder of this report will focus on the unique number of patients rather than number of tests, and those patients that were followed up with by our staff and referred to UC’s Clinical Pharmacy. Since the start of the HCV Dashboard, there have been a total of 30362 unique patients that have been tested for HCV Ab, with a total of 1345 unique patients that were positive for HCV Ab (4.43% of all patients tested, 1345/30362). The unique number of patients tested is determined by the medical record number (MRN) attached to the lab test. The MRN is the identifier used to match back with the EIP REDCap Database to link with the patient’s record to determine follow-up efforts described in the next section.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, there were a total of 1456 HCV positive tests, with 1345 unique individuals. For EIP follow-up, we will focus on the unique number of patients in in regards to education of results or additional testing needed, and linkage to care efforts. A summary flow diagram for EIP’s follow-up efforts regarding those that are identified HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard is provided below. You can zoom into this flow diagram by clicking on the image.\n\n\n\n\n\n** Unable to match records means that we are unable to match the EIP follow-up data with the data pulled from the Epic HCV Dashboard. The reason(s) for why these records are unable to be matched are: Tested under different MRN than patient record.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs already mentioned, there were a total of 1345 HCV Ab+ unique patients from the Epic HCV Dashboard. There were a total of 18 patients (1.3% of all HCV Ab+ patients, 18/1345) that currently do not have an EIP record created for follow-up regarding their HCV Ab+ result, which are in the process of being added. This may also be due to an individual being tested under one MRN, but found to have another MRN upon EIP follow-up, so these cases need to be cleaned and corrected. Based on further HCV RNA testing or recent medical record review, it is known that 542 patients are currently HCV RNA negative (40.3% of all those identified as HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard, 542/1345). While EIP is not calling all those identified as HCV RNA negative to discuss those results due to the additional effort that would be, we do try to notify these patients and provide additional education and interpretation of these results if we catch them while they are still in the ED/hospital. The total number of patients EIP has provided follow-up education after their HCV RNA results negative is 97 patients (17.9% of all those identified as HCV RNA negative, 97/542).\nTherefore, the number of patients who were identified as HCV Ab+ but either are HCV RNA positive or do not have a RNA lab resulted was 799 patients needing follow-up education and referral (59.4% of all those HCV Ab+ from the Epic HCV Dashboard, 799/1345). This means that EIP has been unable to follow-up with 433 patients who were HCV Ab+ and need follow-up results/education (54.2% of all those HCV Ab+ from the Epic HCV Dashboard needing follow-up, 433/799)\nOut of those patients that needed follow-up, EIP staff were able to approach and provide results/education to 366 patients (45.8% of all those identified as HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard needing follow-up, 366/799). EIP makes every attempt to approach the patient while they are still located in the ED or admitted to the hospital. The number of patients where EIP was able to initiate face-to-face contact while they were still in the hospital (whether in the ED or roomed elsewhere) was 173 patients (47.3% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 173/366). If EIP is unable to approach patients while they were still in the ED/hospital, then attempts are made to follow-up with them using the contact information collected during ED intake. The number of patients where EIP was able to contact them after discharge was 180 patients (49.2% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 180/366). Additionally, if EIP is aware that an individual was provided with their results, education, and follow-up linkage referral by other staff through their typical ED treatment and care, then we monitor the case rather than direct involvement in order to decrease duplication of work in getting the patient linked to care. The number of patients where EIP was aware that the patient has been referred for HCV treatment by other staff was 15 patients (4.1% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 15/366).\nThe EIP REDCap Database allows for documentation regarding referral to UC Clinical Pharmacy, as well as linkage to other locations that can manage/treat their HCV. The total number of patients that have been linked to care for HCV was 188 patients (51.4% of all those EIP provided education to, 188/366). The number of patients that were linked to care specifically to the UC Clinical Pharmacy was 169 patients (89.9% of all those patients linked to care, 169/188). Once EIP refers a patient to UC Clinical Pharmacy and gets them scheduled, they are documented as linked to care. It is our current process that UC Clinical Pharmacy will manage and follow-up with those individuals who do not successfully attend those appointments, re-linking them as needed. However, our documentation ends once the referral is made and the appointment is scheduled. The number of patients that were linked to care to a location other than the UC Clinical Pharmacy for HCV treatment is 19 patients (10.1% of all those patients linked to care, 19/188).\nAs part of EIP’s follow-up efforts, we try to ensure anyone who is HCV Ab+ has the necessary lab testing to know if they are currently infected with HCV by facilitating RNA testing when appropriate. The total number of patients that had a follow-up RNA test documented within their EIP REDCap record was 1087 patients (74.7% of all those HCV Ab+, 1087/1345). As mentioned above, there were a total of 542 patients that were negative for HCV RNA, which is 40.3% of all those with a known HCV RNA result (542/1087). For those patients that were tested for RNA, the total number of those that were found to be true positives for HCV was 540 patients (49.7% of all those tested for HCV RNA, 540/1087)."

    "text": "The Epic dashboard for HCV testing went live on January 2nd, 2024. This Epic dashboard lists all University of Cincinnati Medical Center Emergency Department (UCMC ED) based HCV testing ordered, showing the results in real time. EIP staff monitors the HCV dashboard for positive results and approaches patients directly while they are still in the ED, or the hospital, to provide results, education and information for additional testing (if required), as well as linkage to care through UC’s Clinical Pharmacy when appropriate.\nThe total daily testing numbers for HCV Antibody tests (HCV Ab) are shown in the table below, as well as a plot showing the daily trend in testing numbers. The overall HCV Ab positivity rate for the tests included in the HCV Epic Dashboard is described below the plot. The unique number of tests is determined by the Order ID for the test. The test is only included if the Order Status is “Completed” and the Lab Status indicates that it is the “Final Result” and the lab result is provided. The data is manually exported from the Epic HCV Dashboard each week with the data from the prior week by the EIP Data Team, and merged into a single data file used in this analysis, excluding duplicate records.\n\nDailyMonthly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that since the HCV Epic dashboard data is manually extracted from Epic at various times, the total number of tests for the most recent day/month may not all be counted. For example, if data is pulled in the afternoon, then the tests conducted in the morning are counted, but not tests conducted later in the evening for that day. The day that the data was pulled is noted by the date at the top of this report. Also, depending on when the data was pulled, not all test results are finalized, so the positivity rate and number of positive tests/patients may also be slightly different. However, this should only pertain to the day the data is pulled, and not prior days included in the analysis.\nThe total number of HCV Ab tests since the initiation of the HCV Dashboard is 32072 tests. The total number of positive HCV Ab results is 1456 Ab positive tests, which is 4.54% of all HCV Ab tests conducted (1456/32072).\nSince EIP is meant to approach each individual that has a reactive HCV Ab test to provide education, the data provided in the remainder of this report will focus on the unique number of patients rather than number of tests, and those patients that were followed up with by our staff and referred to UC’s Clinical Pharmacy. Since the start of the HCV Dashboard, there have been a total of 30362 unique patients that have been tested for HCV Ab, with a total of 1345 unique patients that were positive for HCV Ab (4.43% of all patients tested, 1345/30362). The unique number of patients tested is determined by the medical record number (MRN) attached to the lab test. The MRN is the identifier used to match back with the EIP REDCap Database to link with the patient’s record to determine follow-up efforts described in the next section.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, there were a total of 1456 HCV positive tests, with 1345 unique individuals. For EIP follow-up, we will focus on the unique number of patients in in regards to education of results or additional testing needed, and linkage to care efforts. A summary flow diagram for EIP’s follow-up efforts regarding those that are identified HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard is provided below. You can zoom into this flow diagram by clicking on the image.\n\n\n\n\n\n** Unable to match records means that we are unable to match the EIP follow-up data with the data pulled from the Epic HCV Dashboard. The reason(s) for why these records are unable to be matched are: Tested under different MRN than patient record.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs already mentioned, there were a total of 1345 HCV Ab+ unique patients from the Epic HCV Dashboard. There were a total of 18 patients (1.3% of all HCV Ab+ patients, 18/1345) that currently do not have an EIP record created for follow-up regarding their HCV Ab+ result, which are in the process of being added. This may also be due to an individual being tested under one MRN, but found to have another MRN upon EIP follow-up, so these cases need to be cleaned and corrected. Based on further HCV RNA testing or recent medical record review, it is known that 542 patients are currently HCV RNA negative (40.3% of all those identified as HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard, 542/1345). While EIP is not calling all those identified as HCV RNA negative to discuss those results due to the additional effort that would be, we do try to notify these patients and provide additional education and interpretation of these results if we catch them while they are still in the ED/hospital. The total number of patients EIP has provided follow-up education after their HCV RNA results negative is 97 patients (17.9% of all those identified as HCV RNA negative, 97/542).\nTherefore, the number of patients who were identified as HCV Ab+ but either are HCV RNA positive or do not have a RNA lab resulted was 799 patients needing follow-up education and referral (59.4% of all those HCV Ab+ from the Epic HCV Dashboard, 799/1345). This means that EIP has been unable to follow-up with 433 patients who were HCV Ab+ and need follow-up results/education (54.2% of all those HCV Ab+ from the Epic HCV Dashboard needing follow-up, 433/799)\nOut of those patients that needed follow-up, EIP staff were able to approach and provide results/education to 366 patients (45.8% of all those identified as HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard needing follow-up, 366/799). EIP makes every attempt to approach the patient while they are still located in the ED or admitted to the hospital. The number of patients where EIP was able to initiate face-to-face contact while they were still in the hospital (whether in the ED or roomed elsewhere) was 173 patients (47.3% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 173/366). If EIP is unable to approach patients while they were still in the ED/hospital, then attempts are made to follow-up with them using the contact information collected during ED intake. The number of patients where EIP was able to contact them after discharge was 180 patients (49.2% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 180/366). Additionally, if EIP is aware that an individual was provided with their results, education, and follow-up linkage referral by other staff through their typical ED treatment and care, then we monitor the case rather than direct involvement in order to decrease duplication of work in getting the patient linked to care. The number of patients where EIP was aware that the patient has been referred for HCV treatment by other staff was 15 patients (4.1% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 15/366).\nThe EIP REDCap Database allows for documentation regarding referral to UC Clinical Pharmacy, as well as linkage to other locations that can manage/treat their HCV. The total number of patients that have been linked to care for HCV was 188 patients (51.4% of all those EIP provided education to, 188/366). The number of patients that were linked to care specifically to the UC Clinical Pharmacy was 169 patients (89.9% of all those patients linked to care, 169/188). Once EIP refers a patient to UC Clinical Pharmacy and gets them scheduled, they are documented as linked to care. It is our current process that UC Clinical Pharmacy will manage and follow-up with those individuals who do not successfully attend those appointments, re-linking them as needed. However, our documentation ends once the referral is made and the appointment is scheduled. The number of patients that were linked to care to a location other than the UC Clinical Pharmacy for HCV treatment is 19 patients (10.1% of all those patients linked to care, 19/188).\nAs part of EIP’s follow-up efforts, we try to ensure anyone who is HCV Ab+ has the necessary lab testing to know if they are currently infected with HCV by facilitating RNA testing when appropriate. The total number of patients that had a follow-up RNA test documented within their EIP REDCap record was 1087 patients (74.7% of all those HCV Ab+, 1087/1345). As mentioned above, there were a total of 542 patients that were negative for HCV RNA, which is 40.3% of all those with a known HCV RNA result (542/1087). For those patients that were tested for RNA, the total number of those that were found to be true positives for HCV was 540 patients (49.7% of all those tested for HCV RNA, 540/1087)."

    "section": "Ineligible LTC Cases",
    "text": "Ineligible LTC Cases\nOnce a linkage case is started, the linkage team determines whether it can realistically be worked based on the outreach abilities of our linkage team. There are several factors that have been determined that make a linkage case “ineligible” to be worked, and are thus excluded from the total number reported to funding entities when reporting linkage data. This “ineligible” definition does not always mean that the individual cannot be linked, but there are significant barriers that our linkage team cannot always overcome based on their position, and we thus do not fault them in an inability to connect the individual to care. These situations are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\nIf an individual states that they are already in care, or if there is clear evidence within the medical record that the individual is successfully engaging in care, then they are termed “ineligible” due to already being linked to care. There may be additional things that our linkage team can assist with, but as far as linkage for HIV care, there is no additional effort our team needs to provide, so they are termed “ineligible” are are not considered out of care. The total number of HIV linkage cases where the individual was known to already be in care are 299 (70.0% of all HIV linkage cases initiated, 299/596).\nIf the individual passes away during their encounter in the emergency department, or while our linkage team is attempting to get them linked to care, then they are termed “ineligible” as they are not able to be followed for care, and thus are excluded from final linkage numbers. The total number of HIV linkage cases where the individual was deceased before linkage could be completed was 12 (2.8% of all HIV linkage cases initiated, 12/596).\nIf the individual is in police custody, or incarcerated while the linkage team is attempting to get them linked to care, then there are often difficulties in establishing communication with the individual and getting them to an appointment with a specialist. While not impossible to link them to care in these situations, it does make it more difficult and could provide significant barriers for our team, and thus are termed “ineligible” if this is the case in that situation. The total number of HIV linkage cases where the individual was incarcerated or in police custody, therefore complicating linkage access, was 13 (3.0% of all HIV linkage cases initiated, 13/596).\nSometimes, the individual may not have contact information in which our linkage team can reach out to initiate contact. This often happens when we are unable to meet the individual while they are in the hospital, and must try to initiate contact through phone calls or other means. This is different than our team having contact information for the individual and they are just unable to contact them through these methods. This “ineligible” criteria is when there is no reliable effort in which to reach the individual, meaning we are unable to actually initiate contact and follow-up. The total number of HIV linkage cases where our linkage team had no ability to contact the individual was 63 (14.8% of all HIV linkage cases initiated, 63/596).\nIf the individual declines our team’s linkage services for any reason, even after multiple offers for support, then they are termed “ineligible” since they do not feel our intervention is necessary at that time. The total number of HIV linkage cases where the individual declined linkage services was 21 (4.9% of all HIV linkage cases initiated, 21/596).\nDue to the length of time that some linkage cases may take, there are several instances where the individual may return and be identified by EIP while they already have an ongoing linkage case. Rather than duplicating the need for linkage, and only maintaining one linkage case at a time, the individual is still marked as identified for linkage, but termed “ineligible” due to ongoing linkage already in progress. The total number of HIV linkage cases where the individual already had an ongoing linkage case in progress was 20 (4.7% of all HIV linkage cases initiated, 20/596)."

    "text": "Eligible LTC Cases\nThere are a total number of 427 HIV linkage cases where the individual meets at least one of these “ineligible” criteria (71.6% of all HIV linkage cases initiated, 427/596), leaving 231 HIV linkage cases that are eligible to be worked by our linkage team (38.8% of all HIV linkage cases initiated, 231/596). This is the total number of HIV Linkage cases that is used when reporting our linkage efforts for HIV. Additionally, HIV linkage is broken out by linkage efforts for those who are newly diagnosed and those individuals that are previously known to be positive requiring re-engagement in care. There are 38 linkage cases eligible for individuals who are New Diagnoses (16.5% of all eligible HIV linkage cases, 38/231) and there are 189 linkage cases for individuals who are Previous Diagnoses (81.8% of all eligible HIV linkage cases, 189/231). It may take some time before it is known whether an individual has a previous diagnosis, or if that instance of when staff identify them as positive is a new diagnosis, depending on the situation. Therefore, we also track the number of eligible HIV linkage cases where the individual has an “unknown diagnosis” status. This does not mean their status is unknown (since HIV linkage is only done for those who are positive), it is unknown whether they are new or previous at the time of the data pull. There are 4 HIV linkage cases where they are in this unknown state (1.7% of all eligible HIV linkage cases, 4/231).\nFrom this point, it is tracked whether a case in open and currently being worked, or whether it is closed and what the final linkage status is for the case. There are a total of 15 HIV linkage cases that are currently open and in progress (6.5% of all eligible HIV linkage cases, 15/231). There are 0 cases open that are for New Diagnoses (0.0% of all eligible HIV cases for New Diagnoses, 0/38) and there are 11 cases open that are for Previous Diagnoses (5.8% of all eligible HIV cases for Previous Diagnoses, 11/189).\nThere are a total of 216 closed HIV linkage cases (93.5% of all eligible HIV linkage cases, 216/231). There was a total of 107 eligible HIV linkage cases where the individual was successfully connected to care (49.5% of all eligible HIV linkage cases, 107/231). The definition used for successful linkage for PLWHA is that they are known to attend an appointment or individualized meeting with a specialist for HIV care, such as at UCMC Infectious Disease Center (IDC). There were a total of 35 cases where the individual was newly diagnosed for HIV that were linked to care (92.1% of all eligible HIV linkage cases for New Diagnoses, 35/38), and a total of 72 cases where the individual was a previously known positive for HIV that were linked to care (38.1% of all eligible HIV linkage cases for Previous Diagnoses, 72/189).\nFor those situations where the individual was eligible to be linked to care, there were a total of 109 cases where they were not successfully established with treatment (50.5% of all eligible HIV linkage cases, 109/231). Out of these, 3 were cases where the individual was newly diagnosed (7.9% of all eligible HIV linkage cases for New Diagnoses, 3/38) and 106 were cases where the individual was previously diagnosed (56.1% of all eligible HIV linkage cases for Previous Diagnoses, 106/189). For situations where the individual was not successfully established with care, the specific reasons as to why they were unable to be linked are documented within the linkage record. There are numerous reasons why an individual may be prevented from being linked, and these reasons are not mutually exclusive. The medical staff or the family may interfere with attempts to get them into care, the patient may refuse to communicate with our linkage team, or there may be no reliable way to contact the individual during follow-up, or any other number of reasons. These reasons are shown in the consort diagram below.\nThe consort or flow diagram below represents all of the linkage data described above visually. All numbers are represented as total (n, blue) and percent (%, steel blue). To know the denominator of each percent represented in the consort diagram below, please refer to the description of the data points in the text above.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur HIV linkage program also has deliverables for HIV linkage to care, requiring that about 80% of our HIV Linkage cases are connected with treatment, encompassing both new and previous diagnoses. For this metric, the total number of cases reported are the total number of HIV cases that are “eligible” for linkage (231 total cases). The total number successfully linked to care (107 linked to care) is reported, with the overall percentage of the total eligible for linkage (49.5% linked to care), while also providing the total number of cases that are still in progress (15 cases in progress) for their understanding of the overall picture at the time of reporting. Linkage to care data is reported for CTR on a mid-year and end of year period, but this data covers all cases covered in this dashboard. The gauge to show how close we are to meeting our deliverable for HIV Linkage to Care goal for the program is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince HIV LTC data is typically reported on an annual basis, the specific HIV linkage numbers for each year are presented below along with the linkage to care success rate.\n\n202520242023\n\n\nThis shows the HIV LTC flow diagram for all linkage cases in 2025, along with the linkage to care success rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows the HIV LTC flow diagram for all linkage cases in 2024, along with the linkage to care success rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows the HIV LTC flow diagram for all linkage cases in 2023, along with the linkage to care success rate."

    "text": "Screening for HT\nEIP officially began screening for human trafficking (HT) within the EIP Database as of December 1st, 2022 with the introduction of Dr. Christa Pulvino’s pilot grant. The EIP assessment has had some general questions that may indicate the risk of an individual being in a HT situation, but new assessment questions were added to indicate a risk for trafficking, as well as the HPA’s general impression of whether the individual was at risk based on additional information. Additional resources for HT were included within the EIP list, and a new, electronic version of the EIP resource list was created that allowed the ability for patients to access the list of EIP resources using a QR code. The data captured for this project is provided on this page, along with additional data that pertains to the HT efforts within EIP.\nThere are a total of 13885 encounters with EIP, with a total of 5877 assessments completed (42.3% of the total number of encounters). As mentioned above, there are several questions within the EIP assessment that may indicate whether someone is in an at-risk situation for HT. The total number of assessments where at least one of these questions was asked and answered is 3186 (54.2% of the total number of assessments, 3186/5877). The questions that are included in the total assessed for HT (in addition to the questions provided by Dr. Pulvino) are noted below:\n\nWhen did you last receive money and/or drugs for sex?\nDo you feel safe in your relationship?\nDoes your partner pressure you into having sex?\n\nHowever, when we only consider those questions that were included with Dr. Pulvino’s HT assessment, the number of assessments where this specific screening was done was 1973 (33.6% of the total number of assessments, 1973/5877). Individuals are considered at risk for HT if they respond ‘Yes’ to any of the questions in this HT assessment. The total number of assessments where an individual screened positive for HT risk is 230 (11.7% of the total assessed using Dr. Pulvino’s assessment, 230/1973). The summary table for HT screening is provided below.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    HT Assessed \n    % Assessed \n    HT Assessed (Pulvino) \n    % Assessed (Pulvino) \n    Screened HT+ \n    % HT+ \n  \n \n\n  \n    3186 \n    54.2% \n    1973 \n    33.6% \n    230 \n    11.7% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe breakdown of the responses for each question on Dr. Pulvino’s HT assessment are provided in the table below to keep track of which specific questions are being asked and answered, and which ones are of highest note for those who are screening positive.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Question \n    # Assessed \n    Yes \n    % Yes \n    No \n    Not Asked \n    Declined \n  \n \n\n  \n    Have you ever worked, or done other things, in a place that made you feel scared or unsafe? \n    1946 \n    145 \n    7% \n    1801 \n    204 \n    31 \n  \n  \n    In thinking back over your past experience, have you ever been tricked or forced into doing any kind of work that you did not want to do? \n    1906 \n    113 \n    6% \n    1793 \n    220 \n    32 \n  \n  \n    Have you ever been afraid to leave or quit a work situation due to fears of violence or threats of harm to yourself or your family? \n    1881 \n    76 \n    4% \n    1805 \n    229 \n    30 \n  \n  \n    Have you ever received anything in exchange for sex (for example, a place to stay, gifts, or food)? \n    1846 \n    138 \n    7% \n    1708 \n    229 \n    30 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, EIP has asked whether an individual has exchanged money and/or drugs for sex. However, these are asked in conjunction with Dr. Pulvino’s question of whether they have ever received anything for sex, not just money or drugs. The response to Dr. Pulvino’s specific question is shown above, but we can also look at the total number of assessments where the individual endorsed receiving anything for sex, whether it was a response to the historical EIP question(s) or the additional question provided by Dr. Pulvino. Looking at the response to all questions related to receiving anything for sex, there were a total of 258 assessments where the individual endorsed receiving anything for sex (8% of all those assessed for HT, 258/3186).\nAdditional questions that can be evaluated in identifying the risk for HT are whether an individual feels safe in their relationship and whether their partner pressures them into having sex. There were a total number of 1842 assessments where the individual answered the question regarding feeling safe in their relationship, with 256 (14% of all those assessed for this question, 256/1842) stating they do not feel safe in their current relationship. There were a total number of 1715 assessments where the individual answered the question regarding being pressured into sex by their partner, with 78 (5% of all those assessed for this question, 78/1715) stating that they have been pressured into sex by their partner.\nAdditionally, the EIP staff are asked to document during their encounter whether they had a feeling of whether the individual was a potential risk for HT, regardless of how they answered the questions and based on their overall impression of the encounter as a whole. There were a total of 64 encounters where the EIP staff indicated that they had a feeling the individual was at risk for being trafficked (0.5% of all encounters, 64/13885). The total number of encounters is used as the denominator here (rather than the number of assessments, or those screened for HT risk) because the EIP staff can note their impression of HT risk without completing an assessment. However, we can also look at this total for those that completed an assessment and those that completed HT screening if desired. When looking at it this way, 1.1% of those that completed an EIP assessment were suspected of being in a trafficking situation by the EIP staff (64/5877), while 2.0% of those who were screened for HT were suspected of being in a trafficked situation (64/3186).\nFor individuals who screened positive for being a HT risk through Dr. Pulvino’s questions, there were 47 assessments where the EIP staff also stated they had the impression that the individual was at risk for being trafficked (20.4% of all those who screened positive for HT, 47/230). There were a total of 1743 assessments where the individual was screened using Dr. Pulvino’s assessment but did not screen positive, and 4 of these where the EIP staff suspected that they may be at risk (0.2% of all those assessed for HT but were not positive, 4/1743).\n\n\nResources for HT\nReferrals to resources for HT are provided by our EIP health promotion advocates (HPAs) after their encounter with the individual. These resources can be provided whether the individual is screened for their risk of HT or not, and can occur at any time during the individual’s encounter within the emergency department. The total number of encounters where resources were provided to the individual by our HPAs was 3524 (25.4% of all encounters, 3524/13885). In order to ensure that all individuals who are screened, and that screened positive, are able to receive the reosurces they need during that encounter. The total number of encounters where the individual screened positive for HT risk and were provided with resources specifically for HT was 113 (49.1% of all those that screened positive, 113/230). Also, when one of our EIP HPAs suspect HT risk, whether they screened positive or not, they are trained to offer resources that may help. The number of encounters where the individual was suspected of being in a trafficked situation by an EIP HPA and where they were provided with referrals was 54 (84.4% of all those that were suspected of HT risk, 54/64). Finally, the number of encounters where an individual was suspected or screened positive for HT during the assessment and was provided resources was 40 (85.1% of all those that were either suspected of or screened positive for HT risk, 40/47).\n\n\nHT Linkage to Care\nThe flowchart of the HT Linkage to Care efforts for EIP are shown below. A linkage case for HT may be started in any situation, and does not require the individual to be screened for HT risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEIP Resource Database\nWith the introduction of screening for human trafficking, EIP established a virtual resource for our services, providing individuals with a way to access and review our resource list anytime using a QR code. This electronic version of the EIP resource list went live on April 19th, 2023. With this electronic version, we are able to analyze which resources visitors review for our services provided in the document, based on what options they select when triggering the QR code. There were a total of 294 queries into the EIP resource list using this QR code, and the particular services they reviewed are shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the number of views for each service alone, providing the percentage of the the total number of views (n = 294) for the EIP resource list. In addition, the table provides numbers when considering the times that the individual selected to view all services, since the same resources for the individualized service would be accessible when viewing all services. Therefore, the percentage of the total for each service when combined with the number of views for all services is also shown.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Resource \n    Numbers of Views \n    % of Total \n    All Services Included \n    % with All Services \n  \n \n\n  \n    All Services \n    148 \n    50.3% \n    - \n    - \n  \n  \n    HIV \n    44 \n    15.0% \n    192 \n    65% \n  \n  \n    Substance Abuse \n    63 \n    21.4% \n    211 \n    72% \n  \n  \n    Housing \n    57 \n    19.4% \n    205 \n    70% \n  \n  \n    Mental Health \n    50 \n    17.0% \n    198 \n    67% \n  \n  \n    Human Trafficking \n    43 \n    14.6% \n    191 \n    65% \n  \n  \n    Survivors of Abuse \n    29 \n    9.9% \n    177 \n    60% \n  \n  \n    Food Services \n    40 \n    13.6% \n    188 \n    64% \n  \n  \n    General Health \n    30 \n    10.2% \n    178 \n    61% \n  \n  \n    Transportation \n    32 \n    10.9% \n    180 \n    61%"

    "text": "The Hamilton County Public Health (HCPH) substance use disorder (SUD) data agreement was initiated in July 2024 and the agreement was for data collected starting August 1, 2024 through July 31, 2025. This agreement is for EIP to provide HCPH with data regarding SUD screening and follow-up at periodic intervals to determine retention in care. The agreement was to provide data for any patient that endorses any opioid and/or stimulant use, the demographic information of these individuals, as well as their treatment need and follow-up for retention in care. This agreement is for patients seen at UC Medical Center only.\nSince the data that HCPH requested for follow-up centered around those that were linked to care, it was decided that aggregate data would be collected for all those individuals screened for SUD, those that endorse current opioid/stimulant use within the past year, those that are engaged with the EIP Linkage to Care process, and those that are successfully linked to care. Then, record-level data would be provided for those that agree to follow-up questionnaires at 30, 60, and 180 day time points, with the follow-up questions from HCPH documented.\nEIP SUD assessments are determined based on the AUDIT-C for alcohol or NIDA-Modified ASSIST for all other substances. Aggregate-level data is presented here for the following: number screened for SUD, number endorsing current opioid/stimulant use (within the past year), number engaged in SUD linkage, number successfully linked to care, and the number that agreed to follow-up beyond linkage success. As of the start of the data sharing agreement for this program, there have been a total of 1557 encounters where an individual was screened for SUD. The number of encounters where an individual has endorsed current substance use (within the past year) for opioids and/or stimulants were 379 encounters (24.3% of all those screened for SUD, 379/1557). After a conversation with the EIP HPA and/or LTC Coordinator, there was a total of 120 encounters where the individual engaged in our linkage process specifically for SUD (31.7% of all those who endorsed current opioid/stimulant use, 120/379). For those that engaged with our SUD LTC process, there were a total of 41 encounters where the individual was successfully linked to care for SUD (34.2% of all those engaged in SUD LTC, 41/120). There were then a total of 30 encounters where the individual agreed to additional follow-up beyond successful linkage for SUD (73.2% of all those successfully linked to care for SUD, 30/41). The table below summarizes this monthly aggregate-level data for SUD screening and linkage to care at UCMC ED since the start of this program.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    SUD Assessed \n    Current Opioid/Stimulant Use \n    Engaged in SUD LTC \n    Linked for SUD \n    Agreed to Follow-up \n  \n \n\n  \n    2024-08-01 \n    158 \n    41 \n    21 \n    5 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    2024-09-01 \n    134 \n    31 \n    12 \n    6 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    2024-10-01 \n    172 \n    46 \n    24 \n    10 \n    10 \n  \n  \n    2024-11-01 \n    113 \n    25 \n    9 \n    3 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    2024-12-01 \n    76 \n    14 \n    4 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    2025-01-01 \n    100 \n    28 \n    13 \n    5 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    2025-02-01 \n    74 \n    26 \n    9 \n    5 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    2025-03-01 \n    101 \n    28 \n    5 \n    2 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    2025-04-01 \n    138 \n    31 \n    6 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    2025-05-01 \n    240 \n    42 \n    7 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    2025-06-01 \n    208 \n    55 \n    7 \n    3 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    2025-07-01 \n    43 \n    12 \n    3 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flow diagram below highlights the total aggregate-level data with numbers for each step in the process, with total numbers so far for the project.

Everyone who agreed to the additional follow-up is eligible for the 30 day follow-up as long as their follow-up date is 30-days after their successful linkage to care date for SUD. Eligibility for 60-day follow-up requires the individual complete their 30-day follow-up and that we have reached 60-days post-linkage. Eligibility for the 180-day follow-up requires successful completion of their 60-day follow-up and that we have reached 180-day post-linkage. There were a total of 30 encounters where the individual agreed to the HCPH 30/60/180 day follow-ups after successful linkage (73.2% of all those successfully linked to care for SUD, 30/41). These are the individuals that are being followed-up with by our linkage team for responses to the HCPH 30/60/180 day follow-up surveys.\nThere were a total of 30 encounters (100.0% of all those successfully linked to care for SUD) where the individual was eligible for their 30 day follow-up, and our linkage team was successfully able to complete 6 of these 30 day follow-ups (20.0% of all those eligible for their 30 day follow-up, 6/30).\nThere were a total of 7 encounters (116.7% of all those who successfully completed their 30 day follow-up) where the individual was eligible for their 60 day follow-up, and our linkage team was successfully able to complete 3 of these 60 day follow-ups (42.9% of all those eligible for their 60 day follow-up, 3/6).\nThere were a total of 1 encounters (100.0% of all those who successfully completed their 60 day follow-up) where the individual was eligible for their 180 day follow-up, and our linkage team was successfully able to complete 0 of these 180 day follow-ups (0.0% of all those eligible for their 180 day follow-up, 0/3).\nThe flow diagram below summarizes all of the follow-up data for those individuals who were successfully linked to care for SUD and agreed to additional follow-up."

    "text": "Fentanyl Test Strips\nDuring the EIP assessment and discussion with the patient/client, the HPA asks questions regarding the individual’s knowledge of harm reduction tools. More specifically, the individual is asked whether they are aware of tools used to test drugs for the presence of fentanyl, meaning their knowledge of fentanyl test strips (FTS). This assessment of their knowledge of harm reduction tools is available for all those receiving an EIP assessment, regardless of any indication of their own history of substance use. The total number of assessments where this question was answered was 1048 (17.8% of all assessments completed, 1048/5877). This question asks for a yes/no response, and the total number of assessments where the indiviudal responded that they were aware of FTS was 516 (49.2% of all those asked about their knowledge of FTS, 516/1048). If they stated that they were aware of FTS, the indiviudal is then asked about their prior use of these harm reduction tools. The total number of assessments where the individual stated that they were aware of FTS that answered this follow-up question was 445 (86.2% of all assessments where the individual was aware of FTS, 445/516). Again, this is a yes/no response, and the total number of assessments where the individual stated that they have used FTS before was 246 (55.3% of all assessments where the individual was asked about prior FTS use, 246/445).\nFor those individuals that screened positive for any type of SUD through the EIP assessment, the number of assessments where they were also assessed for their knowledge of FTS was 375 (28.1% of all SUD positive assessments, 375/1335), with 212 stating that they were aware of FTS (56.5% of all SUD positive assessments where the individual was also assessed for FTS knowledge, 212/375). The number of assessments where the individual screened positive for any SUD where they were also assessed for their prior use of FTS was 195 (92.0% of all SUD positive assessments that were aware of FTS, 195/212), with 111 endorsing prior use of FTS (56.9% of all SUD positive assessments also assessed for prior FTS use, 111/195).\nDuring each encounter, individuals are also offered these harm reduction tools and provided with FTS if they are interested in receiving them at that time. The number of assessments where individuals who were asked whether they would be interested in recieving FTS was 1055 (18.0% of all assessments, 1055/5877), with 429 stating that they were interested (40.7% of all assessed for interest in receiving FTS, 429/1055). Once they stated that they had an interst in recieving FTS during their encounter, the HPA documents whether they were able to provide the individual with FTS and how many they were given for reporting purposes. The number of times the individual was provided with FTS during their encounter was 403 (93.9% of all times when the individual stated interest in receiving FTS, 403/429).\nFor those that screened positive for any type of SUD during their encounter, the number of assessments where individuals who were asked whether they would be interested in recieving FTS was 376 (28.2% of all assessments where the individual screened positive for a SUD, 376/1335), with 185 stating that they were interested (49.2% of all SUD positive assessments also assessed for interest in receiving FTS, 185/376). The number of times where the individual screened positive for a SUD and was provided with FTS during their encounter was 176 (95.1% of all times when the individual screened SUD positive and stated interest in receiving FTS, 176/185).\nThe total number of FTS distributed is reported on a monthly basis required for being a Project Dawn site, starting August 1st, 2023. Therefore, the total number of strips distributed are counted on a monthly basis and provided in the graph."

    "text": "Naloxone Distribution\nWork in progress\nNaloxone distribution is documented in two different programs within EIP: (1) direct naloxone distribution of kits provided through grants, and (2) facilitated distribution where EIP prompts medical staff to distribute naloxone from the Omnicell within UCMC and WCH EDs after discussion with the patient. The two programs will be discussed separately below. Also, the number of kits distributed from the UCMC and WCH Omnicells will be provided with the direct distribution information because those numbers are reported alongside the distribution of our EIP kits.\nWith Project Dawn naloxone distribution, there are three different “versions” or methods of distribution that are recorded: (1) Individual distribution, (2) Transfer to an agency, and (3) Overdose Awareness Day and Recovery Month Event. For each of these versions of distribution, there are different data points collected and required for reporting. Individual distribution is when we provide naloxone kits to an individual person, and we collect data regarding their demographics, area in which they live, and past history with overdose and naloxone use. Transfer to an agency is when we provide a batch of kits for an agency for them to distribute on their own, and we just document how many kits were provided to them, but no additional information is collected as with individual distributions. Finally, Overdose Awareness Day (OAD) and Recovery month events are any combination of the first two versions, only that they must occur on OAD (August 31st) or during recovery month (September 30th). With this version, we also only collect specifics about the setting of the distribution and the total number of kits, but not information about the individual receiving the naloxone kit(s). The table below shows the total number of distribution events (not number of kits) for each of these types of distribution versions.\n\n\nWarning: 'xfun::attr()' is deprecated.\nUse 'xfun::attr2()' instead.\nSee help(\"Deprecated\")\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    Total distribution events \n  \n \n\n  \n    Individual Distribution \n    2592 \n  \n  \n    Transfer to an Agency \n    60 \n  \n  \n    OAD & Recovery Month \n    139 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally for transferring kits to an agency, Project Dawn asks for additional information regarding the type of transfer. There are three transfer types: (1) One-time partner for distribution, (2) Service entity first aid, and (3) Public NaloxBox/cabinet. The table below shows the number of distribution events (not number of kits) involving a transfer of kits to an agency for each of these transfer types.\n\n\nWarning: 'xfun::attr()' is deprecated.\nUse 'xfun::attr2()' instead.\nSee help(\"Deprecated\")\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    Total distribution events \n  \n \n\n  \n    One-time partner for distribution \n    55 \n  \n  \n    Service entity first aid \n    3 \n  \n  \n    Public NaloxBox/cabinet \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot below shows the monthly naloxone kit distributions, which are the numbers reported to ODH each month.

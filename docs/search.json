Currently, there are several methods for testing, with various funding streams built within the program. The various projects that involve HIV testing are covered on this page, with specific deliverables promised within each project provided under the ‘Deliverables’ tab above. In parallel with lab-based testing conducted within the hospital and/or clinical settings, rapid-based testing conducted by the EIP is covered under several different grants, and will be the focus of this dashboard.\nThe following table shows an overview of the total number of HIV tests within each testing program, with the total positives (and those newly diagnosed through these tests).

    "text": "Ineligible LTC Cases\nOnce a linkage case is started, the linkage team determines whether it can realistically be worked based on the outreach abilities of our linkage team. There are several factors that have been determined that make a linkage case “ineligible” to be worked, and are thus excluded from the total number reported to funding entities when reporting linkage data. This “ineligible” definition does not always mean that the individual cannot be linked, but there are significant barriers that our linkage team cannot always overcome based on their position, and we thus do not fault them in an inability to connect the individual to care. These situations are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\nIf an individual states that they are already in care, or if there is clear evidence within the medical record that the individual is successfully engaging in care, then they are termed “ineligible” due to already being linked to care. There may be additional things that our linkage team can assist with, but as far as linkage for HIV care, there is no additional effort our team needs to provide, so they are termed “ineligible” are are not considered out of care. The total number of HIV linkage cases where the individual was known to already be in care are 419 (71.5% of all HIV linkage cases initiated, 419/831).\nIf the individual passes away during their encounter in the emergency department, or while our linkage team is attempting to get them linked to care, then they are termed “ineligible” as they are not able to be followed for care, and thus are excluded from final linkage numbers. The total number of HIV linkage cases where the individual was deceased before linkage could be completed was 12 (2.0% of all HIV linkage cases initiated, 12/831).\nIf the individual is in police custody, or incarcerated while the linkage team is attempting to get them linked to care, then there are often difficulties in establishing communication with the individual and getting them to an appointment with a specialist. While not impossible to link them to care in these situations, it does make it more difficult and could provide significant barriers for our team, and thus are termed “ineligible” if this is the case in that situation. The total number of HIV linkage cases where the individual was incarcerated or in police custody, therefore complicating linkage access, was 18 (3.1% of all HIV linkage cases initiated, 18/831).\nSometimes, the individual may not have contact information in which our linkage team can reach out to initiate contact. This often happens when we are unable to meet the individual while they are in the hospital, and must try to initiate contact through phone calls or other means. This is different than our team having contact information for the individual and they are just unable to contact them through these methods. This “ineligible” criteria is when there is no reliable effort in which to reach the individual, meaning we are unable to actually initiate contact and follow-up. The total number of HIV linkage cases where our linkage team had no ability to contact the individual was 82 (14.0% of all HIV linkage cases initiated, 82/831).\nIf the individual declines our team’s linkage services for any reason, even after multiple offers for support, then they are termed “ineligible” since they do not feel our intervention is necessary at that time. The total number of HIV linkage cases where the individual declined linkage services was 30 (5.1% of all HIV linkage cases initiated, 30/831).\nDue to the length of time that some linkage cases may take, there are several instances where the individual may return and be identified by EIP while they already have an ongoing linkage case. Rather than duplicating the need for linkage, and only maintaining one linkage case at a time, the individual is still marked as identified for linkage, but termed “ineligible” due to ongoing linkage already in progress. The total number of HIV linkage cases where the individual already had an ongoing linkage case in progress was 27 (4.6% of all HIV linkage cases initiated, 27/831)."

    "section": "Eligible LTC Cases",
    "text": "Eligible LTC Cases\nThere are a total number of 586 HIV linkage cases where the individual meets at least one of these “ineligible” criteria (70.5% of all HIV linkage cases initiated, 586/831), leaving 326 HIV linkage cases that are eligible to be worked by our linkage team (39.2% of all HIV linkage cases initiated, 326/831). This is the total number of HIV Linkage cases that is used when reporting our linkage efforts for HIV. Additionally, HIV linkage is broken out by linkage efforts for those who are newly diagnosed and those individuals that are previously known to be positive requiring re-engagement in care. There are 54 linkage cases eligible for individuals who are New Diagnoses (16.6% of all eligible HIV linkage cases, 54/326) and there are 270 linkage cases for individuals who are Previous Diagnoses (82.8% of all eligible HIV linkage cases, 270/326). It may take some time before it is known whether an individual has a previous diagnosis, or if that instance of when staff identify them as positive is a new diagnosis, depending on the situation. Therefore, we also track the number of eligible HIV linkage cases where the individual has an “unknown diagnosis” status. This does not mean their status is unknown (since HIV linkage is only done for those who are positive), it is unknown whether they are new or previous at the time of the data pull. There are 2 HIV linkage cases where they are in this unknown state (0.6% of all eligible HIV linkage cases, 2/326).\nFrom this point, it is tracked whether a case in open and currently being worked, or whether it is closed and what the final linkage status is for the case. There are a total of 32 HIV linkage cases that are currently open and in progress (9.8% of all eligible HIV linkage cases, 32/326). There are 4 cases open that are for New Diagnoses (7.4% of all eligible HIV cases for New Diagnoses, 4/54) and there are 27 cases open that are for Previous Diagnoses (10.0% of all eligible HIV cases for Previous Diagnoses, 27/270).\nThere are a total of 294 closed HIV linkage cases (90.2% of all eligible HIV linkage cases, 294/326). There was a total of 137 eligible HIV linkage cases where the individual was successfully connected to care (46.6% of all eligible HIV linkage cases, 137/326). The definition used for successful linkage for PLWHA is that they are known to attend an appointment or individualized meeting with a specialist for HIV care, such as at UCMC Infectious Disease Center (IDC). There were a total of 45 cases where the individual was newly diagnosed for HIV that were linked to care (83.3% of all eligible HIV linkage cases for New Diagnoses, 45/54), and a total of 92 cases where the individual was a previously known positive for HIV that were linked to care (34.1% of all eligible HIV linkage cases for Previous Diagnoses, 92/270).\nFor those situations where the individual was eligible to be linked to care, there were a total of 157 cases where they were not successfully established with treatment (53.4% of all eligible HIV linkage cases, 157/326). Out of these, 5 were cases where the individual was newly diagnosed (9.3% of all eligible HIV linkage cases for New Diagnoses, 5/54) and 151 were cases where the individual was previously diagnosed (55.9% of all eligible HIV linkage cases for Previous Diagnoses, 151/270). For situations where the individual was not successfully established with care, the specific reasons as to why they were unable to be linked are documented within the linkage record. There are numerous reasons why an individual may be prevented from being linked, and these reasons are not mutually exclusive. The medical staff or the family may interfere with attempts to get them into care, the patient may refuse to communicate with our linkage team, or there may be no reliable way to contact the individual during follow-up, or any other number of reasons. These reasons are shown in the consort diagram below.\nThe consort or flow diagram below represents all of the linkage data described above visually. All numbers are represented as total (n, blue) and percent (%, steel blue). To know the denominator of each percent represented in the consort diagram below, please refer to the description of the data points in the text above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur HIV linkage program also has deliverables for HIV linkage to care, requiring that about 80% of our HIV Linkage cases are connected with treatment, encompassing both new and previous diagnoses. For this metric, the total number of cases reported are the total number of HIV cases that are “eligible” for linkage (326 total cases). The total number successfully linked to care (137 linked to care) is reported, with the overall percentage of the total eligible for linkage (46.6% linked to care), while also providing the total number of cases that are still in progress (32 cases in progress) for their understanding of the overall picture at the time of reporting. Linkage to care data is reported for CTR on a mid-year and end of year period, but this data covers all cases covered in this dashboard. The gauge to show how close we are to meeting our deliverable for HIV Linkage to Care goal for the program is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince HIV LTC data is typically reported on an annual basis, the specific HIV linkage numbers for each year are presented below along with the linkage to care success rate.\n\n202520242023\n\n\nThis shows the HIV LTC flow diagram for all linkage cases in 2025, along with the linkage to care success rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows the HIV LTC flow diagram for all linkage cases in 2024, along with the linkage to care success rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows the HIV LTC flow diagram for all linkage cases in 2023, along with the linkage to care success rate."

The aggregate data is further divided into several tabs, each depending on the site where the test occurred. The aggregate data report is essentially divided by the two ED testing sites (UCMC and WCH), the community sites (termed non-traditional testing venues), and the syringe exchange sites. It also consists of the demographic and population data for those tested at these sites. The positivity report identifies the total number of positive tests done at each site per month. The opscan report shows individual-level data regarding personal risk and testing history, with a few additional identifiable data points.\nThe figure below shows the monthly EHE testing numbers. It is important to note that there may be a few duplicated tests due to the transition to the new year, and records being in both the 2025 and 2026 databases if an open linkage case from 2025 is actively being worked in the 2026 database. Continuous review and data cleaning occurs until all cases from the prior year are closed."

    "text": "PLWHA\nThe first impact objective encompasses population-based objectives centered around people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) that are identified not in care. This objective has EIP staff identify those either newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed and determine whether they are out of care and require linkage to care services. This objective is inclusive of those who are women of color (WOC), youth (18-29 years old), and injection drug users (IDU). The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2026, EIP will identify 30 PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care as prioritized by RFP workplan table. Of note, this number PLWHA includes newly diagnosed positives found by ED staff testing that, while apart from the core CTR, would not be possible absent the existence of the CTR (as detailed in Program Narrative).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many PLWHA who are out of care that will be identified by our program, and successfully link 80% of those individuals to care. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nPLWHA are identified in several different ways within the program, including: self-report of a positive test on assessment of prior HIV testing history, reason for offering an HIV test was due to a prior HIV positive result, declining an HIV test due to prior positive result, a final positive result through HIV testing, or having an HIV linkage case open with a new or previous HIV status. EIP staff are meant to identify all PLWHA encountered through the program, and further follow-up and discussion are meant to determine who is currently out of care. The deliverable for all PLWHA identified out of care are those that are “eligible” to be linked to care. They are considered “ineligible” based on the following criteria: they are already linked to care, deceased, currently incarcerated, inaccurate contact information, or they declined EIP linkage services.\nThe total number of HIV linkage to care (LTC) cases initiated for PLWHA during this time period is 236, with the total number of “eligible” LTC cases for PLWHA being 87 (36.9% of all HIV LTC cases initiated, 87/236). Therefore, EIP has identified 87 PLWHA for the EHE deliverable, which is 290.0% of the total promise of 30. The total number of these “eligible” HIV LTC cases that have been successfully linked to care is 28, which is 32.2% of those “eligible” (28/87).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not separate linkage numbers based on the HIV testing program (CTR/EHE), so these numbers are pulled the same as the numbers that are reported for the linkage deliverables shown for the CTR program. If there are differences in the documented numbers for linkage between these two testing programs, it is likely due to the timeframe used for each program deliverable. The HIV Linkage flow diagram for the EHE deliverable timeframe is shown below to provide an understanding of where the linkage numbers are coming from."

Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2026, EIP will identify 60 MSM for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide HIV testing to 60 MSM, inclusive of the following (40 UCMC site, 20 community/outpatient sites; 40 Youth (18-29), and 10 IDU). EIP will identify 10 HIV(+) MSM for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1). Of note, this does not include MSM PLWHA who are either previously diagnosed or those newly diagnosed by usual ED staff apart from CTR\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many MSM will be assessed for risk and/or need, and how many MSM will be tested using EHE-funded tests. Additionally, EIP states a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, community sites). Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table in the next section.\nFor those individuals who identify as a male, they are determined to be a MSM if they meet at least one of the following criteria: their sexual orientation is homosexual or bisexual, they report sex with a male within the past year, or they are a PLWHA and their reported risk was MSM. The total number of individuals who are MSM that have been assessed during this time period is 72, which is 120.0% of the total promise of 60.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of individuals who are MSM that have been tested through the EHE program is 9, which is 15.0% of the total promise of 60. In addition to the total number of tests, there were deliverables for the location where those tests were conducted. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those EHE tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED). There were a total number of 1 EHE tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 2.5% of the total promise of 40. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those EHE tests that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED). There were a total number of r EHE tests that were conducted at WCH, which is r of the total promise of r. For the community-based tests, this includes all tests that were conducted anywhere EIP operates that does not include one of the EDs (UCMC or WCH). There were a total number of 8 EHE tests that were conducted in the community, which is 40.0% of the total promise of 20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the EHE workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 0 EHE tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 10. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the EHE program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the EHE program addresses particular population groups for testing. Within the population of MSM, we additionally have deliverables for youth and IDU. For those that are considered in the youth population, EHE defines those between the age of 18-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 18, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 7 EHE tests where the individual was both MSM/Youth, which is 17.5% of the total promise of 40. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 0 EHE tests where the individual was both MSM/IDU, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 10."

The figure below shows the monthly CTR testing numbers for the current grant period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deliverables highlighted below are the numbers that were noted on the 2025 CTR Workplan as what our program would accomplish within the year of funding awarded. The data shown in the table below covers the CTR program deliverables starting July 1st, 2025 through May 31, 2026.

This objective has EIP staff identify those either newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed with HIV and determine whether they are currently out of care, requiring linkage to care services. This objective is inclusive of those who are women of color (WOC), youth (15-29 years old), and injection drug users (IDU). The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2026, EIP will perform 125 risk assessments on PLWHA not in care (newly and previously diagnosed) and provide Prevention with Positives and Linkage to Care services such that 80% are engaged in HIV medical care, inclusive of the following (80 at UCMC, 10 WCH, and 5 at the SSP; of which will be 10 WOC, 25 Youth (18-29), and 30 IDU) as prioritized by RFP workplan table.\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many PLWHA who are out of care that will be identified by our program, and successfully link 80% of those individuals to care. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nPLWHA are identified in several different ways within the program, including: self-report of a prior positive test during the assessment of HIV testing history, reason for offering an HIV test was due to a prior HIV positive result, declining an HIV test due to prior positive result, a final positive result through HIV testing, or having an HIV linkage case open with a new or previous HIV status. EIP staff are meant to identify all PLWHA encountered through the program, with further follow-up and discussion meant to determine who is currently out of care. The deliverable for all PLWHA identified out of care are those that are “eligible” to be linked to care within the linkage flow process (diagrammed below). They are considered “ineligible” based on the following criteria: they are already linked to care, they are deceased, they are currently incarcerated, we do not have accurate contact information to follow-up with them, they already have an ongoing linkage case for HIV within the program, or they declined EIP linkage services. These situations are determined “ineligible” linkage cases because of the significant level of barriers our program faces in certain situations, or because they cannot be realistically linked through our linkage process. While it is possible for our team to link individuals to care in some of these cases, as a whole they are termed “ineligible” due to the complexity of their situation. The numbers provided here are based on the total number of encounters, not unique number of patients, because EIP may encounter individuals frequently throughout the reporting period and identify them as being out of care during any of these encounters.\nThe total number of HIV linkage to care (LTC) cases initiated for PLWHA during this time period is 236, with the total number of “eligible” LTC cases for PLWHA being 87 (36.9% of all HIV LTC cases initiated, 87/236). Therefore, EIP has identified 87 PLWHA for the CTR deliverable, which is 69.6% of the total promise of 125. The total number of these “eligible” HIV LTC cases that have been successfully linked to care is 28, which is 32.2% of those “eligible” (28/87).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not separate linkage numbers based on the HIV testing program (CTR/EHE), so these numbers are pulled the same as the numbers that are reported for the linkage deliverables shown for the EHE program. If there are differences in the documented numbers for linkage between these two testing programs, it is likely due to the timeframe used for each program deliverable. The HIV Linkage flow diagram for the CTR deliverable timeframe is shown below to provide an understanding of where the linkage numbers are coming from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional deliverables were made for identifying PLWHA at specific sites where EIP operates. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those individuals identified within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 80 PLWHA identified at UCMC, which is 100.0% of the total promise of 80. For West Chester Hospital (WCH), this includes only those individuals identified within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 2 PLWHA identified at at WCH, which is 20.0% of the total promise of 10. For the SSP locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any location where the Syringe Service Program (SSP) operates. There were a total number of 3 PLWHA identified at SSP locations, which is 60.0% of the total promise of 5. The bullet chart below shows the promised deliverables for each site and our current efforts toward those goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, for this objective regarding PLWHA, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for linkage to care. EIP additionally has deliverables for those who are HIV+ and are also WOC, youth and IDU. For those who are WOC, this is defined as any individual who identifies as female whose race/ethnicity is not ‘White/Caucasian’. There were a total number of 18 PLWHA who were also WOC, which is 180.0% of the total promise of 10. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP can encounter individuals younger than the age of 15 (although rarely), so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 7 PLWHA who were also Youth, which is 28.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their associated risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 16 PLWHA who were also IDU, which is 53.3% of the total promise of 30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the mid-year and end-of-year reports to HCPH for linkage numbers, we report the total number of PLWHA that were out of care, whether newly diagnosed or previously known to be positive. The report independently notes the total number of PLWHA who were new diagnoses or previous diagnoses, and the total. This report also determines the number of cases currently in progress (broken down by new/previous/total), and the number of cases successfully closed (broken down by new/previous/total). For those cases that were closed, we report the total number that were successfully linked to care (broken down by new/previous/total) and the number that were not linked to care (broken down by new/previous/total). The table belows shows how these numbers are reported to HCPH at the mid-year and end-of-year reports.\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    New Dx # \n    New Dx % \n    Previous Dx # \n    Previous Dx % \n    Total # \n    Total % \n  \n \n\n  \n    # PLWHA Out of Care \n    14 \n     \n    71 \n     \n    87 \n     \n  \n  \n    Cases in Progress \n    5 \n    35.7% \n    29 \n    40.8% \n    35 \n    40.2% \n  \n  \n    Cases Closed \n    9 \n    17.3% \n    42 \n    80.8% \n    52 \n    59.8% \n  \n  \n    Linked to Care \n    9 \n    64.3% \n    19 \n    26.8% \n    28 \n    32.2% \n  \n  \n    Not Linked to Care \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    23 \n    32.4% \n    24 \n    46.2% \n  \n\n\n\n\nAny discrepancies in the total numbers compared to the individual new/previous numbers is likely due to the situation when the HIV status in a linkage case has not yet been determined as a new diagnosis or a previous diagnosis.\n\n\n\nThere were additional deliverables made for population-based objectives, and the first focuses on those who identify as men who have sex with other men (MSM). Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2026 EIP will identify 150 MSM for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client- centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 100 MSM, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC, 10 at the SSP, and 5 at community-based organizations; of which will be 25 Youth (15-29) and 25 IDU). Of the 100 MSM tested, EIP will identify between 3-5 HIV(+) MSM for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many MSM will be assessed for risk and/or need, and how many MSM will be tested using CTR-funded tests. Additionally, EIP states a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, the SSP, and community). EIP also states how many MSM will be tested using CTR-funded tests who are also youth (15-29) and injection drug users (IDU), as well as a specific number of newly diagnosed individuals who identify as MSM. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nFor those individuals who identify as a male, they are determined to be a MSM if they meet at least one of the following criteria: they identify as Male and their sexual orientation is homosexual or bisexual, they report sex with a male within the past year, or they are a PLWHA and their reported risk was MSM. The total number of individuals who are MSM that have been assessed during this time period is 72, which is 48.0% of the total promise of 150.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of individuals who are MSM that have been tested through the CTR program is 40, which is 40.0% of the total promise of 100. In addition to the total number of tests, there were deliverables for the location where those tests were conducted. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 30 CTR tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 40.0% of the total promise of 75. For the SSP locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any location where the Syringe Service Program (SSP) operates. There were a total number of 5 CTR tests that were conducted at SSP locations, which is 50.0% of the total promise of 10. For the other community locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any community based site. There were a total number of 5 CTR tests that were conducted in community locations, which is 100.0% of the total promise of 5. Other community site testing is included in the total number of tests conducted, but not in these particular site-based deliverables. The bullet chart below shows the promised deliverables for each site and our current efforts toward those goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the CTR workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals who identify as MSM who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 1 MSM CTR tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 33.3% of the total promise of 3. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the CTR program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be further broken down monthly to determine how frequently we test those who identify as MSM, and determine if program evaluation needs to occur based on how we can increase testing for this population or whether decreased testing numbers are due to staffing changes and program barriers. The monthly breakdown of MSM CTR testing by month is shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for testing. Within the population of MSM, we additionally have deliverables for youth and IDU. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 23 CTR tests where the individual was both MSM/Youth, which is 92.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 7 CTR tests where the individual was both MSM/IDU, which is 28.0% of the total promise of 25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were additional deliverables made for population-based objectives, and the second focuses on those who identify as heterosexual that are at high risk for contracting HIV by endorsing high-risk heterosexual sex (HRHS) behaviors. Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2026, EIP will identify 1150 HRHS for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 800 HRHS, inclusive of the following (550 UCMC, 50 WCH, 150 at the SSP site, 100 at community-based street outreach; of which will be Group 31, Grouped object130 WOC, 200 Youth (15-29), and 300 IDU). Of the 800 HRHS tested, EIP will identify 9 HIV(+) HRHS for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many HRHS will be assessed for risk and/or need, how many HRHS individuals will be tested through CTR-funded tests, and state a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, the SSP, and community). Additionally, EIP stated specific populations within those who are HRHS, including WOC, youth (15-29), and IDU. EIP also stated a specific number of individuals newly diagnosed with HIV through CTR testing. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nFor those individuals who identify as a heterosexual (men who have sex with women, or women who have sex with men), they are determined to be HRHS if they meet at least one of the following criteria: heterosexual women that have unprotected sex with men or MSM, heterosexual men/women that have sex with an IDU, an HIV positive partner, a STD positive partner, more than three partners, or heterosexual men/women that exchange money/drugs for sex. These behaviors are all within the past year.\nThe total number of encounters with individuals who are HRHS that have been assessed during this time period is 583, which is 50.7% of the total promise of 1150. In addition to the total number of assessments, there were deliverables for the number of CTR-funded tests performed. The total number of encounters where HRHS individuals were tested is 343, which is 42.9% of the total promise of 800.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were also deliverables for the number of tests performed at specific sites where EIP operates. For UCMC, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by a CTR test that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 294 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 53.5% of the total promise of 550. For WCH, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by a CTR test that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 0 CTR HRHS assessments that were conducted at WCH, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 50. For the SSP, this includes any site where the SSP operates. There were a total number of 38 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at the SSP, which is 25.3% of the total promise of 150. For the other community locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any community based community site. There were a total number of 11 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted in the community, which is 11.0% of the total promise of 100. Other community site testing is included in the total number of tests conducted, but not in these particular site-based deliverables. The bullet chart below shows the promised deliverables for each site and our current efforts toward those goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the CTR workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals that are HRHS who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 6 HRHS CTR tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 66.7% of the total promise of 9. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the CTR program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be further broken down monthly to determine how frequently we test those who are HRHS, and determine if program evaluation needs to occur based on how we can increase testing for this population or whether decreased testing numbers are due to staffing changes and program barriers. The monthly breakdown of HRHS CTR testing by month is shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for testing. Within the population of HRHS, we additionally have deliverables for WOC, youth and IDU. For those who are WOC, this is defined as any individual who identifies as female whose race/ethnicity is not ‘White/Caucasian’. There were a total number of 109 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/WOC, which is 83.8% of the total promise of 130. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 158 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/Youth, which is 79.0% of the total promise of 200. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 64 CTR tests where the individual was both HRHS/IDU, which is 21.3% of the total promise of 300.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional metrics still to code for:\n\nNumber of PLWHA approached\nNumber receiving intervention\nNumber of interactions between EIP staff and site staff\nNumber/% of PLWHA not in care (new and previous)\nNumber/% of PLWHA linked to medical care and other services\nNumber/% of PLWHA receiving risk assessment and counseling\nNumber of MSM approached\nNumber of MSM receiving intervention\nNumber/% of HIV(-) MSM receiving risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral\nNumber/% of MSM receiving HIV testing\nNumber/% of MSM who test HIV+\nNumber HRHS approached\nNumber receiving intervention\nNumber/% of HIV(-) HRHS receiving risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral\nNumber/% of HRHS receiving HIV testing\nNumber/% HRHS who test HIV+"

For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP can encounter individuals younger than the age of 15 (although rarely), so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 7 PLWHA who were also Youth, which is 28.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their associated risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 16 PLWHA who were also IDU, which is 53.3% of the total promise of 30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the mid-year and end-of-year reports to HCPH for linkage numbers, we report the total number of PLWHA that were out of care, whether newly diagnosed or previously known to be positive. The report independently notes the total number of PLWHA who were new diagnoses or previous diagnoses, and the total. This report also determines the number of cases currently in progress (broken down by new/previous/total), and the number of cases successfully closed (broken down by new/previous/total). For those cases that were closed, we report the total number that were successfully linked to care (broken down by new/previous/total) and the number that were not linked to care (broken down by new/previous/total). The table belows shows how these numbers are reported to HCPH at the mid-year and end-of-year reports.\n\n\n\n \n  \n     \n    New Dx # \n    New Dx % \n    Previous Dx # \n    Previous Dx % \n    Total # \n    Total % \n  \n \n\n  \n    # PLWHA Out of Care \n    14 \n     \n    71 \n     \n    87 \n     \n  \n  \n    Cases in Progress \n    5 \n    35.7% \n    29 \n    40.8% \n    35 \n    40.2% \n  \n  \n    Cases Closed \n    9 \n    17.3% \n    42 \n    80.8% \n    52 \n    59.8% \n  \n  \n    Linked to Care \n    9 \n    64.3% \n    19 \n    26.8% \n    28 \n    32.2% \n  \n  \n    Not Linked to Care \n    0 \n    0.0% \n    23 \n    32.4% \n    24 \n    46.2% \n  \n\n\n\n\nAny discrepancies in the total numbers compared to the individual new/previous numbers is likely due to the situation when the HIV status in a linkage case has not yet been determined as a new diagnosis or a previous diagnosis."

    "text": "There were additional deliverables made for population-based objectives, and the first focuses on those who identify as men who have sex with other men (MSM). Individuals are only identified as a part of this population group if they complete the necessary portions on the EIP assessment. The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2026 EIP will identify 150 MSM for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client- centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 100 MSM, inclusive of the following (75 at UCMC, 10 at the SSP, and 5 at community-based organizations; of which will be 25 Youth (15-29) and 25 IDU). Of the 100 MSM tested, EIP will identify between 3-5 HIV(+) MSM for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many MSM will be assessed for risk and/or need, and how many MSM will be tested using CTR-funded tests. Additionally, EIP states a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, the SSP, and community). EIP also states how many MSM will be tested using CTR-funded tests who are also youth (15-29) and injection drug users (IDU), as well as a specific number of newly diagnosed individuals who identify as MSM. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nFor those individuals who identify as a male, they are determined to be a MSM if they meet at least one of the following criteria: they identify as Male and their sexual orientation is homosexual or bisexual, they report sex with a male within the past year, or they are a PLWHA and their reported risk was MSM. The total number of individuals who are MSM that have been assessed during this time period is 72, which is 48.0% of the total promise of 150.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total number of individuals who are MSM that have been tested through the CTR program is 40, which is 40.0% of the total promise of 100. In addition to the total number of tests, there were deliverables for the location where those tests were conducted. For the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC), this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 30 CTR tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 40.0% of the total promise of 75. For the SSP locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any location where the Syringe Service Program (SSP) operates. There were a total number of 5 CTR tests that were conducted at SSP locations, which is 50.0% of the total promise of 10. For the other community locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any community based site. There were a total number of 5 CTR tests that were conducted in community locations, which is 100.0% of the total promise of 5. Other community site testing is included in the total number of tests conducted, but not in these particular site-based deliverables. The bullet chart below shows the promised deliverables for each site and our current efforts toward those goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the CTR workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals who identify as MSM who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 1 MSM CTR tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 33.3% of the total promise of 3. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the CTR program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be further broken down monthly to determine how frequently we test those who identify as MSM, and determine if program evaluation needs to occur based on how we can increase testing for this population or whether decreased testing numbers are due to staffing changes and program barriers. The monthly breakdown of MSM CTR testing by month is shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the CTR program addresses particular population groups for testing. Within the population of MSM, we additionally have deliverables for youth and IDU. For those that are considered in the youth population, CTR defines those between the age of 15-19 years old. However, EIP often encounters individuals younger than the age of 15, so the definition used here are those below the age of 29. There were a total number of 23 CTR tests where the individual was both MSM/Youth, which is 92.0% of the total promise of 25. For those that are considered in the IDU population, the individual needs to complete the necessary section within the EIP assessment. We define those who endorse injection drug use behavior ever in their lifetime on the NIDA-Modified ASSIST, or those who are HIV positive and their risk was injection drug use as a part of the IDU population. There were a total number of 7 CTR tests where the individual was both MSM/IDU, which is 28.0% of the total promise of 25."

The statement for the actual deliverables promised for this objective is noted below:\n\nBy May 31, 2026, EIP will identify 1150 HRHS for risk-assessment and prevention intervention including client-centered risk reduction counseling and PrEP education/referral. EIP will provide CTR testing to 800 HRHS, inclusive of the following (550 UCMC, 50 WCH, 150 at the SSP site, 100 at community-based street outreach; of which will be Group 31, Grouped object130 WOC, 200 Youth (15-29), and 300 IDU). Of the 800 HRHS tested, EIP will identify 9 HIV(+) HRHS for the PLWHA program (Workplan Form 4, Part 1).\n\nFrom this statement, we specifically state deliverables for how many HRHS will be assessed for risk and/or need, how many HRHS individuals will be tested through CTR-funded tests, and state a specific number of tests at each site (UCMC, WCH, the SSP, and community). Additionally, EIP stated specific populations within those who are HRHS, including WOC, youth (15-29), and IDU. EIP also stated a specific number of individuals newly diagnosed with HIV through CTR testing. Additional metrics were noted in this section, but no specific details on the numbers for those metrics were provided. Therefore, we stated we would monitor and report those as needed. These metrics are shown in the table under ‘Additional Metrics’.\nFor those individuals who identify as a heterosexual (men who have sex with women, or women who have sex with men), they are determined to be HRHS if they meet at least one of the following criteria: heterosexual women that have unprotected sex with men or MSM, heterosexual men/women that have sex with an IDU, an HIV positive partner, a STD positive partner, more than three partners, or heterosexual men/women that exchange money/drugs for sex. These behaviors are all within the past year.\nThe total number of encounters with individuals who are HRHS that have been assessed during this time period is 583, which is 50.7% of the total promise of 1150. In addition to the total number of assessments, there were deliverables for the number of CTR-funded tests performed. The total number of encounters where HRHS individuals were tested is 343, which is 42.9% of the total promise of 800.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were also deliverables for the number of tests performed at specific sites where EIP operates. For UCMC, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by a CTR test that were conducted within the emergency department (UCMC ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 294 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at UCMC, which is 53.5% of the total promise of 550. For WCH, this includes only those assessments that were accompanied by a CTR test that were conducted within the emergency department (WCH ED) or with admitted patients within the hospital. There were a total number of 0 CTR HRHS assessments that were conducted at WCH, which is 0.0% of the total promise of 50. For the SSP, this includes any site where the SSP operates. There were a total number of 38 CTR HRHS tests that were conducted at the SSP, which is 25.3% of the total promise of 150. For the other community locations, this includes only those CTR tests that were conducted at any community based community site.

Other community site testing is included in the total number of tests conducted, but not in these particular site-based deliverables. The bullet chart below shows the promised deliverables for each site and our current efforts toward those goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we do not separate the linkage data between the various testing programs, we can identify which testing programs identify new positive HIV diagnoses. According to the CTR workplan, EIP has promised to identify a certain number of individuals that are HRHS who are newly diagnosed for HIV. There were a total number of 6 HRHS CTR tests that resulted in a new positive diagnosis for the individual tested, which is 66.7% of the total promise of 9. This number of new positive diagnoses are only those that were tested through the CTR program, and this only considers new positive diagnoses, not those that were tested and later determined to be an individual known to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be further broken down monthly to determine how frequently we test those who are HRHS, and determine if program evaluation needs to occur based on how we can increase testing for this population or whether decreased testing numbers are due to staffing changes and program barriers.

    "text": "The Epic dashboard for HCV testing went live on January 2nd, 2024. This Epic dashboard lists all University of Cincinnati Medical Center Emergency Department (UCMC ED) based HCV testing ordered, showing the results in real time. EIP staff monitors the HCV dashboard for positive results and approaches patients directly while they are still in the ED, or the hospital, to provide results, education and information for additional testing (if required), as well as linkage to care through UC’s Clinical Pharmacy when appropriate.\nThe total daily testing numbers for HCV Antibody tests (HCV Ab) are shown in the table below, as well as a plot showing the daily trend in testing numbers. The overall HCV Ab positivity rate for the tests included in the HCV Epic Dashboard is described below the plot. The unique number of tests is determined by the Order ID for the test. The test is only included if the Order Status is “Completed” and the Lab Status indicates that it is the “Final Result” and the lab result is provided. The data is manually exported from the Epic HCV Dashboard each week with the data from the prior week by the EIP Data Team, and merged into a single data file used in this analysis, excluding duplicate records.\n\nDailyMonthly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that since the HCV Epic dashboard data is manually extracted from Epic at various times, the total number of tests for the most recent day/month may not all be counted. For example, if data is pulled in the afternoon, then the tests conducted in the morning are counted, but not tests conducted later in the evening for that day. The day that the data was pulled is noted by the date at the top of this report. Also, depending on when the data was pulled, not all test results are finalized, so the positivity rate and number of positive tests/patients may also be slightly different. However, this should only pertain to the day the data is pulled, and not prior days included in the analysis.\nThe total number of HCV Ab tests since the initiation of the HCV Dashboard is 45880 tests. The total number of positive HCV Ab results is 2004 Ab positive tests, which is 4.37% of all HCV Ab tests conducted (2004/45880).\nSince EIP is meant to approach each individual that has a reactive HCV Ab test to provide education, the data provided in the remainder of this report will focus on the unique number of patients rather than number of tests, and those patients that were followed up with by our staff and referred to UC’s Clinical Pharmacy. Since the start of the HCV Dashboard, there have been a total of 41938 unique patients that have been tested for HCV Ab, with a total of 1841 unique patients that were positive for HCV Ab (4.39% of all patients tested, 1841/41938). The unique number of patients tested is determined by the medical record number (MRN) attached to the lab test. The MRN is the identifier used to match back with the EIP REDCap Database to link with the patient’s record to determine follow-up efforts described in the next section.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, there were a total of 2004 HCV positive tests, with 1841 unique individuals. For EIP follow-up, we will focus on the unique number of patients in in regards to education of results or additional testing needed, and linkage to care efforts. A summary flow diagram for EIP’s follow-up efforts regarding those that are identified HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard is provided below. You can zoom into this flow diagram by clicking on the image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs already mentioned, there were a total of 1841 HCV Ab+ unique patients from the Epic HCV Dashboard. There were a total of 22 patients (1.2% of all HCV Ab+ patients, 22/1841) that currently do not have an EIP record created for follow-up regarding their HCV Ab+ result, which are in the process of being added. This may also be due to an individual being tested under one MRN, but found to have another MRN upon EIP follow-up, so these cases need to be cleaned and corrected. Based on further HCV RNA testing or recent medical record review, it is known that 769 patients are currently HCV RNA negative (41.8% of all those identified as HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard, 769/1841). While EIP is not calling all those identified as HCV RNA negative to discuss those results due to the additional effort that would be, we do try to notify these patients and provide additional education and interpretation of these results if we catch them while they are still in the ED/hospital. The total number of patients EIP has provided follow-up education after their HCV RNA results negative is 118 patients (15.3% of all those identified as HCV RNA negative, 118/769).\nTherefore, the number of patients who were identified as HCV Ab+ but either are HCV RNA positive or do not have a RNA lab resulted was 1086 patients needing follow-up education and referral (59.0% of all those HCV Ab+ from the Epic HCV Dashboard, 1086/1841). This means that EIP has been unable to follow-up with 607 patients who were HCV Ab+ and need follow-up results/education (55.9% of all those HCV Ab+ from the Epic HCV Dashboard needing follow-up, 607/1086)\nOut of those patients that needed follow-up, EIP staff were able to approach and provide results/education to 479 patients (44.1% of all those identified as HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard needing follow-up, 479/1086). EIP makes every attempt to approach the patient while they are still located in the ED or admitted to the hospital. The number of patients where EIP was able to initiate face-to-face contact while they were still in the hospital (whether in the ED or roomed elsewhere) was 245 patients (51.1% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 245/479). If EIP is unable to approach patients while they were still in the ED/hospital, then attempts are made to follow-up with them using the contact information collected during ED intake. The number of patients where EIP was able to contact them after discharge was 223 patients (46.6% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 223/479). Additionally, if EIP is aware that an individual was provided with their results, education, and follow-up linkage referral by other staff through their typical ED treatment and care, then we monitor the case rather than direct involvement in order to decrease duplication of work in getting the patient linked to care. The number of patients where EIP was aware that the patient has been referred for HCV treatment by other staff was 17 patients (3.5% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 17/479).\nThe EIP REDCap Database allows for documentation regarding referral to UC Clinical Pharmacy, as well as linkage to other locations that can manage/treat their HCV. The total number of patients that have been linked to care for HCV was 263 patients (54.9% of all those EIP provided education to, 263/479). The number of patients that were linked to care specifically to the UC Clinical Pharmacy was 234 patients (89.0% of all those patients linked to care, 234/263). Once EIP refers a patient to UC Clinical Pharmacy and gets them scheduled, they are documented as linked to care. It is our current process that UC Clinical Pharmacy will manage and follow-up with those individuals who do not successfully attend those appointments, re-linking them as needed. However, our documentation ends once the referral is made and the appointment is scheduled. The number of patients that were linked to care to a location other than the UC Clinical Pharmacy for HCV treatment is 30 patients (11.4% of all those patients linked to care, 30/263).\nAs part of EIP’s follow-up efforts, we try to ensure anyone who is HCV Ab+ has the necessary lab testing to know if they are currently infected with HCV by facilitating RNA testing when appropriate. The total number of patients that had a follow-up RNA test documented within their EIP REDCap record was 1557 patients (77.7% of all those HCV Ab+, 1557/1841). As mentioned above, there were a total of 769 patients that were negative for HCV RNA, which is 41.8% of all those with a known HCV RNA result (769/1557). For those patients that were tested for RNA, the total number of those that were found to be true positives for HCV was 783 patients (50.3% of all those tested for HCV RNA, 783/1557)."

The number of patients where EIP was able to contact them after discharge was 223 patients (46.6% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 223/479). Additionally, if EIP is aware that an individual was provided with their results, education, and follow-up linkage referral by other staff through their typical ED treatment and care, then we monitor the case rather than direct involvement in order to decrease duplication of work in getting the patient linked to care. The number of patients where EIP was aware that the patient has been referred for HCV treatment by other staff was 17 patients (3.5% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 17/479).\nThe EIP REDCap Database allows for documentation regarding referral to UC Clinical Pharmacy, as well as linkage to other locations that can manage/treat their HCV. The total number of patients that have been linked to care for HCV was 263 patients (54.9% of all those EIP provided education to, 263/479). The number of patients that were linked to care specifically to the UC Clinical Pharmacy was 234 patients (89.0% of all those patients linked to care, 234/263). Once EIP refers a patient to UC Clinical Pharmacy and gets them scheduled, they are documented as linked to care. It is our current process that UC Clinical Pharmacy will manage and follow-up with those individuals who do not successfully attend those appointments, re-linking them as needed. However, our documentation ends once the referral is made and the appointment is scheduled. The number of patients that were linked to care to a location other than the UC Clinical Pharmacy for HCV treatment is 30 patients (11.4% of all those patients linked to care, 30/263).\nAs part of EIP’s follow-up efforts, we try to ensure anyone who is HCV Ab+ has the necessary lab testing to know if they are currently infected with HCV by facilitating RNA testing when appropriate. The total number of patients that had a follow-up RNA test documented within their EIP REDCap record was 1557 patients (77.7% of all those HCV Ab+, 1557/1841). As mentioned above, there were a total of 769 patients that were negative for HCV RNA, which is 41.8% of all those with a known HCV RNA result (769/1557). For those patients that were tested for RNA, the total number of those that were found to be true positives for HCV was 783 patients (50.3% of all those tested for HCV RNA, 783/1557)."

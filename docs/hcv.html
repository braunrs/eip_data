<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hcv-epic-dashboard">HCV Epic Dashboard</h2>
<p>The Epic dashboard for HCV testing went live on <strong>January 2nd, 2024</strong>. This Epic dashboard lists all University of Cincinnati Medical Center Emergency Department (UCMC ED) based HCV testing ordered, showing the results in real time. EIP staff monitors the HCV dashboard for positive results and approaches patients directly while they are still in the ED, or the hospital, to provide results, education and information for additional testing (if required), as well as linkage to care through UC’s Clinical Pharmacy when appropriate.</p>
<p>The total daily testing numbers for HCV Antibody tests (HCV Ab) are shown in the table below, as well as a plot showing the daily trend in testing numbers. The overall HCV Ab positivity rate for the tests included in the HCV Epic Dashboard is described below the plot. The unique number of tests is determined by the <em>Order ID</em> for the test. The test is only included if the <em>Order Status</em> is “Completed” and the <em>Lab Status</em> indicates that it is the “Final Result” and the lab result is provided. The data is manually exported from the Epic HCV Dashboard each week with the data from the prior week by the EIP Data Team, and merged into a single data file used in this analysis, excluding duplicate records.</p>

<p>It is important to note that since the HCV Epic dashboard data is manually extracted from Epic at various times, the total number of tests for the most recent day/month may not all be counted. For example, if data is pulled in the afternoon, then the tests conducted in the morning are counted, but not tests conducted later in the evening for that day. The day that the data was pulled is noted by the date at the top of this report. Also, depending on when the data was pulled, not all test results are finalized, so the positivity rate and number of positive tests/patients may also be slightly different. However, this should only pertain to the day the data is pulled, and not prior days included in the analysis.</p>
<p>The total number of HCV Ab tests since the initiation of the HCV Dashboard is <strong>32072 tests</strong>. The total number of positive HCV Ab results is <strong>1456 Ab positive tests</strong>, which is <span style="color: red;"><strong>4.54%</strong></span> of all HCV Ab tests conducted (<em>1456/32072</em>).</p>
<p>Since EIP is meant to approach each individual that has a reactive HCV Ab test to provide education, the data provided in the remainder of this report will focus on the unique number of patients rather than number of tests, and those patients that were followed up with by our staff and referred to UC’s Clinical Pharmacy. Since the start of the HCV Dashboard, there have been a total of <strong>30362 unique patients</strong> that have been tested for HCV Ab, with a total of <strong>1345 unique patients</strong> that were positive for HCV Ab (<em>4.43% of all patients tested, 1345/30362</em>). The unique number of patients tested is determined by the medical record number (MRN) attached to the lab test. The MRN is the identifier used to match back with the EIP REDCap Database to link with the patient’s record to determine follow-up efforts described in the next section.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="eip-follow-up">EIP Follow-up</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, there were a total of 1456 HCV positive tests, with 1345 unique individuals. For EIP follow-up, we will focus on the unique number of patients in in regards to education of results or additional testing needed, and linkage to care efforts. A summary flow diagram for EIP’s follow-up efforts regarding those that are identified HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard is provided below. You can zoom into this flow diagram by clicking on the image.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>As already mentioned, there were a total of 1345 HCV Ab+ unique patients from the Epic HCV Dashboard. There were a total of 18 patients (<em>1.3% of all HCV Ab+ patients, 18/1345</em>) that currently do not have an EIP record created for follow-up regarding their HCV Ab+ result, which are in the process of being added. This may also be due to an individual being tested under one MRN, but found to have another MRN upon EIP follow-up, so these cases need to be cleaned and corrected. Based on further HCV RNA testing or recent medical record review, it is known that <strong>549 patients</strong> are currently HCV RNA negative (<em>40.8% of all those identified as HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard, 549/1345</em>). While EIP is not calling all those identified as HCV RNA negative to discuss those results due to the additional effort that would be, we do try to notify these patients and provide additional education and interpretation of these results if we catch them while they are still in the ED/hospital. The total number of patients EIP has provided follow-up education after their HCV RNA results negative is <strong>98 patients</strong> (<em>17.9% of all those identified as HCV RNA negative, 98/549</em>).</p>
<p>Therefore, the number of patients who were identified as HCV Ab+ but either are HCV RNA positive or do not have a RNA lab resulted was <strong>805 patients</strong> needing follow-up education and referral (<em>59.9% of all those HCV Ab+ from the Epic HCV Dashboard, 805/1345</em>). This means that EIP has been unable to follow-up with <strong>423 patients</strong> who were HCV Ab+ and need follow-up results/education (<em>52.5% of all those HCV Ab+ from the Epic HCV Dashboard needing follow-up, 423/805</em>)</p>
<p>Out of those patients that needed follow-up, EIP staff were able to approach and provide results/education to <strong>382 patients</strong> (<em>47.5% of all those identified as HCV Ab+ through the HCV Dashboard needing follow-up, 382/805</em>). EIP makes every attempt to approach the patient while they are still located in the ED or admitted to the hospital. The number of patients where EIP was able to initiate face-to-face contact while they were still in the hospital (whether in the ED or roomed elsewhere) was <strong>184 patients</strong> (<em>48.2% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 184/382</em>). If EIP is unable to approach patients while they were still in the ED/hospital, then attempts are made to follow-up with them using the contact information collected during ED intake. The number of patients where EIP was able to contact them after discharge was <strong>187 patients</strong> (<em>49.0% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 187/382</em>). Additionally, if EIP is aware that an individual was provided with their results, education, and follow-up linkage referral by other staff through their typical ED treatment and care, then we monitor the case rather than direct involvement in order to decrease duplication of work in getting the patient linked to care. The number of patients where EIP was aware that the patient has been referred for HCV treatment by other staff was <strong>15 patients</strong> (<em>3.9% of all HCV Ab positive patients that were provided with education, 15/382</em>).</p>
<p>The EIP REDCap Database allows for documentation regarding referral to UC Clinical Pharmacy, as well as linkage to other locations that can manage/treat their HCV. The total number of patients that have been linked to care for HCV was <strong>200 patients</strong> (<em>52.4% of all those EIP provided education to, 200/382</em>). The number of patients that were linked to care specifically to the UC Clinical Pharmacy was <strong>179 patients</strong> (<em>89.5% of all those patients linked to care, 179/200</em>). Once EIP refers a patient to UC Clinical Pharmacy and gets them scheduled, they are documented as linked to care. It is our current process that UC Clinical Pharmacy will manage and follow-up with those individuals who do not successfully attend those appointments, re-linking them as needed. However, our documentation ends once the referral is made and the appointment is scheduled. The number of patients that were linked to care to a location other than the UC Clinical Pharmacy for HCV treatment is <strong>22 patients</strong> (<em>11.0% of all those patients linked to care, 22/200</em>).</p>
<p>As part of EIP’s follow-up efforts, we try to ensure anyone who is HCV Ab+ has the necessary lab testing to know if they are currently infected with HCV by facilitating RNA testing when appropriate. The total number of patients that had a follow-up RNA test documented within their EIP REDCap record was <strong>1133 patients</strong> (<em>77.8% of all those HCV Ab+, 1133/1345</em>). As mentioned above, there were a total of 549 patients that were negative for HCV RNA, which is 40.8% of all those with a known HCV RNA result (<em>549/1133</em>). For those patients that were tested for RNA, the total number of those that were found to be true positives for HCV was <strong>582 patients</strong> (<em>51.4% of all those tested for HCV RNA, 582/1133</em>).</p>
